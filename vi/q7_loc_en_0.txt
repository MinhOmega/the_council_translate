Ariadne... 
In Greek mythology, she helped Theseus to get through the labyrinth... 
Hmm, looks like there's a crack in the region of the heart... 
The state the stone of the statue is in reminds me of the sword.
I'll bet my boots this is where Mother wanted to lure Mortimer.
Just need to know why... 
Who is it again?
In Greek mythology, Ariadne helped Theseus out of the labyrinth.
Translate the plaque
“I guide the sword that will kill the monster”.
Remember your lessons... 
If I recall the Iliad, Ariadne is none other than the daughter of Minos and Pasiphae... 
She was in love with Theseus and helped him in his quest to kill the Minotaur in return for a promise of marriage if he defeated the monster.
She gave him a reel of thread so that he could find his way back through the labyrinth, which was famous for being unsolveable.
But once the beast was slain, the gallant was quick to abandon her on an island.
Turns out heroes are not what they once were... 
Observe the crack
Let's see... 
Examine the crack
A crack as long as my finger... 
Thrust a sword into the crack
Now what's going to happen if...  if I've got it wrong...

Bandages...  someone's been patching themselves up.
Looks like my mother took advantage of being in hiding to change her bandages, huh... 
This is silk...  She must have used her own clothes.
Inspect the bandages.
These bandages are pretty basic.
She'll be lucky if she doesn't get an infection.
Notice something.
Hmm, there are patches where the blood isn't totally clotted, that's a good sign, right?
She changed them recently.
Which proves she's still looking after herself, and still believes in her chances.
I'd love to tell her to keep hanging in there.

Daedalus.
He is the architect of the labyrinth... 
And if I am not mistaken, he's also the father of Icarus.
The style of the statue reminds me of the sword I found.
I bet this is where my mother got it.
Who's Daedalus again?
If I remember rightly, he is the one who built the labyrinth for Minos.
Translate the plaque
“I am the architect of my own demise”
Remember the mythology
Architect and genius inventor, he built the labyrinth for Minos, to imprison the Minotaur.
I seem to recall that he told Ariadne how to get out of the labyrinth by tying a thread to himself... 
So, Theseus managed to exit the labyrinth without trouble, once the beast was dead.
And when Minos found him, he threw him into his own labyrinth along with his son Icarus.
Every action causes a reaction...

The son of Daedalus and Naucrate.
Impossible to mistake him with those wings!
After flying too close to the sun, they came unstuck and he fell to his death.
Pity.
Hmm...  the stone of the statue reminds me of the sword I picked up.
I get the feeling I'm back on your trail again, Mother! Hang on a little longer...

Remember the myth.
If I remember rightly, Icarus was the son of Daedalus.
He found himself confined to the labyrinth with his father, after his father betrayed Minos...

You again?
Goddamnit, are you following me?
Wouldn't dream of it, Sir.
Well, Monsieur de Richet... 
What brings you here?
Looking for a new prey to thrash, is he?
And yourself? You wouldn't be looking for another woman to beat up by any chance, would you?
Right ! This conversation is over.
And yourself?
To tell the truth, I was wondering the same thing about you!
It's rare for guests to wander about in the garden.
I wanted to be alone for five minutes.
You look worried.
Worried...  no, not anymore.
Resolved would be a more exact term.
Resolved to do what?
Can I trust him?
If I tell you what I'm looking for, Monsieur Péru, will you promise to keep it to yourself?
Hell no.
And anybody who gives you a promise like that is an unmitigated liar!
Trust no one, Monsieur de Richet or you'll soon be a dead man... 
I bid you good luck, you'll need it... 
I'm trying to find out Mortimer's little secrets.
I'm not giving up.
You see, I sense there's something hidden in this garden and I intend to find out what it is... 
You've got some balls, I'll give you that..
Watch your back, though. There are no secrets here.
If Lord Mortimer finds out you've been searching his island, he'll make you pay dearly!
Thanks for the advice.
Are you going to denounce me then?
What's the point of answering, you wouldn't believe me anyway.
I'll be leaving now because whatever it is you're up to, I do NOT want to know .
Be seeing you.
SUCCESS
Tell me, aren't you even curious?
Curiosity killed the cat, Monsieur de Richet.
I admit, I may have judged you wrongly.
Watching you seek out Mortimer's little secrets might even be amusing, if I didn't already know the consequences.
See you later.
You fear Mortimer that much?
What scares you so much?
Don't mess with him, Monsieur.
If he offers his help, refuse it. Keep your freedom and get far away from here while you still can.
What did he do to you?
What happened to you, Monsieur?
It's time for me to assume the consequences of MY choices.
I've sold my soul to the devil, and now it's time to pay.
What consequences?
What do you mean by consequences?
You seem exhilarated by all this.
But if you continue down that path, you'll end up selling your soul to him too.
Well, I warned you.
Good luck to you, Monsieur.
(default)
I'm looking for my mother.
I'm still looking for my mother, of course.
You're right, Monsieur. Keep looking.
Good luck to you.
I dropped by on the off chance.
I just happened to be passing.
Of course you were... 
Say no more, I will take my leave. I certainly don't want to be mixed up in your plans.
Minos.
Son of Zeus and Europa.
If I remember correctly he was the King of Crete.
Married to Pasiphae, he had many children including the famous Ariadne, whom history remembers for her thread.
Hey, there's a crack in that statue.
On closer inspection, I think the sword I found at Mortimer's came from here. The stone, the erosion... 
I'd bet my life I'm on the right track!
Who's Minos again?
He and his queen, Pasiphae, were the monarchs of Crete.
Translate the plaque
“His gesture sealed his fate”.
Remember the myth.
In mythology, King Minos was known as a wise and just king. Despite the fact that he deceived Poseidon.
As punishment, his country was devastated by the white bull of the sea god and his wife became passionately in love with it.
From their union Asterion was born, sadly known to us as the Minotaur.
The illegitimate child, the child of shame...  who had a sorry fate.
And to think that Minos ended up as a judge of the Underworld...  Decidedly, the high and mighty always manage to get away with it...

Asterion.
It is rare to see him like this.
In general, he's represented with the head of a bull, with the features of the Minotaur.
The famous son of Minos and Pasiphae.
Judging from the state of the statue, I'd bet my life this is where the sword I found came from.
Getting there!
Who's that again?
Asterion, son of Minos and Pasiphae.
Asterion, who had such a sad fate, and who the legend portrays as the horrible Minotaur.
Translate the plaque
“I am the cursed child”
Remember the legend.
Asterion was the son of Pasiphae and Minos, or rather the result of a curse put on Minos... 
Minos was punished...  for betraying Poseidon.
Of course...  as, strangely, it often happens, it wasn't he who was punished, it was his wife... 
She had to mate with a bull...  no less... 
From that union, Asterion was born who everyone knows as the famous Minotaur.
Rejected by Minos, he was shut up in the labyrinth so he could never leave.
And as if that wasn't bad enough, he died by the hand of a hero desperate to restore his reputation... 
Think about the meaning of the myth.
Technically, Asterion is the victim of the story because he's described as a child cast out from birth.
Born from an extramarital union because of the errors of his father, he was treated as an outcast all his life... 
And he died as innocently as he was born.
A tragic story, as the Greeks knew how to do so well...

Daughter of Perseus and sister of Circe, she married Minos and became the Queen of Crete.
I think the sword I found goes here. It's the same kind of stone.

I seem to recall that her fate was not something you'd want.
She was punished for the sins of her husband. She had to mate with the sacred bull of Poseidon.
Nine months later she gave birth to Asterion, better known as the Minotaur... 
It's crazy to see to what extent women have always been mistreated.
When they're not harpies, gorgons and other witches, they become victims.
Notice something.
She has no cracks.
For once justice is done. She won't pay for the errors of the others...

We must absolutely inform Sir Gregory.
How long has he been trying to collect all the spears?
I must have brought him the first one twenty odd years ago... 
Do you know if he has managed to get the original?
Well, in any case he's got all the ones we had at the Vatican. He made me replace them with copies.
But I don't understand your reaction. I'm sure it is nothing serious.
Ahaa! I can see very well you do not understand.
You have done nothing less than sign our death warrants, and still you don't understand.
I... Someone is listening!
What... 
Monsieur de Richet, why not join us rather than find yourself eavesdropping?
I...  I...  I didn't want to interrupt you, I'm sorry.
Of course, you didn't.
So, my son, what can we do for you?
Speak about the stone sword.
I was wondering if you might have seen an object like this here at the manor.
What are you playing at, de Richet?
I'm afraid I can't help you, my son.
Ask someone who knows the manor better than I do, one of the servants, for example. One of them is bound to help you.
Thank you for your advice, your Eminence
Delve deeper into their discussion... 
I didn't mean to spy on you, but you caught my attention.
What were you talking about?
I heard you speaking about Sir Gregory and I wondered what it was about.
That is none of your business, Monsieur.
Don't take it the wrong way, Louis, but you shouldn't be eavesdropping.
It seemed important.
Your Eminence, I don't know what you said to Mr Von Wöllner but the poor fellow looks positively crestfallen.
Not all all, don't... 
Don't you believe it, Louis, I was just telling Monsieur about Lord Mortimer's burning passion for holy Relics.
You must have noticed he's a bit of a "collector".
Well, for years he has been searching high and low to bring all the copies of the Holy Spear together.
As I was coming here, I thought I'd bring him a few of them.
That's all.
Be quiet for God's sake!
Pretend to know.
Have you brought Spears as well, then?
What?
Did Mortimer ask you to bring him Holy Spears too?
Yes, but I thought I was the only one.
How many of them have you brought, then?
Eighteen in all. Any relic even remotely to do with them, in fact.
Eighteen spears?
How many of them exist in all?
No one knows. Especially as there is only one authentic one, of course.
That all adds to the mystery, don't you think?
Well... 
Reassure them
Please excuse me if I interrupt, gentlemen.
I didn't want to disturb you, please, carry on.
Your Eminence, you were talking about the Holy Spear, if I remember correctly. The one that killed Christ on the cross, is that right?
Indeed, Louis. I was just telling Mr Von Wöllner about Lord Mortimer's keen interest in the relic.
He's been collecting them for years in the hope that he'll find the real one.
Enough!
Leave them.
Nothing in particular. I'll leave you alone.
Do you think he heard us... 
Don't worry... 
Please leave us, Monsieur. His Eminence and I wish to finish our discussion alone.
Pity, but I've got no time to lose!
Pity, but I've got no time to lose!
You're joking, I hope! Don't tell me you've done that.
Really, how do you expect me to guess?
For God's sake, just ask then.

BlaBlablah

Leave us, now!
What is that?
Looks like a sort of opening mechanism.

Analyze
Knowing Mortimer, I bet it's booby-trapped.
There's a little hole at the fingers. I'm pretty sure if I get it wrong, I'll get pricked.
Damn you Mortimer...  It reminds me of traps I studied in Egyptian tombs.

The sword came from here... But what could it have been used for?
The sword came from here... But what could it have been used for?
What can I do for you, sir?
I am at your service, day and night, sir.
Ask about the sword.
Could you tell me where this sword comes from, please?
Certainly, Sir.
How did such a sword come into Sir's hands?
I'm the one asking the questions.
My good man, I'm afraid you're overstepping your role.
You're the one who's supposed to be giving the answers, not me.
(Louis points out to the servant that he ought to just keep to his duty.)
Naturally, I hope that Sir will forgive me.
I'm in a hurry!
Listen, my good man, I'd gladly stand here discussing matters all day long, but I'm terribly pressed for time.
Your petty logistical concerns are of no interest to me.
I asked you a question and I'm still waiting for an answer.
Do please excuse me, sir.
It's a lead to locate my mother.
I think the whole manor knows that Sarah de Richet has disappeared. And well, I'm on the case, so please give me an answer.
Very well, sir.
If I were Sir, I would look in the garden. This sword looks like it's from the garden statues.
And how can I get into the garden?
There are two ways, sir.
The first way to get to the garden is by the hall, between the conference room and the portrait gallery.
The second way is directly through the portrait gallery. Sir would just have to go out by the French windows.
Thank you, my good man.
What can you tell me about our host?
I would like you to speak about your master, Lord Mortimer.
Do please excuse me, sir, but I shall make no comment about my master.
Is there anything else that sir would like to know?
What can you tell me about the guests?
What can you tell me about the guests?
Do excuse me, sir, but I am bound by discretion to say nothing about Lord Mortimer's guests, sir.
Perhaps sir would like to know something else?
I have a few questions about the manor.
What can I find on the ground floor?
Yes. Can you briefly describe the ground floor, please?
Very well, sir.
On the ground floor, there are mainly living rooms.
Sir finds himself at present in the Grand Hall.
From the Grand Hall, sir can access, on one side, the Small Salon where the guests like to relax with a good book.
From there, sir can access the Conference Room, which is closed at present for preparations.
That is where Lord Mortimer likes to gather all of his guests for talks.
From the other side of the Grand Hall, sir may access the Dining Room.
That is where sir's meals will be served.
From the Dining Room, sir may benefit from an exceptional view overlooking the island.
It is also the best way to access the Portrait Gallery, where a large part of Lord Mortimer's works are exhibited.
And in the gallery, sir will also find access to the Garden.
But sir may be reassured, the building is accessible on both sides, so that it surrounds the Garden in question.
So, sir should not find cause to worry, no one has ever gotten lost.
Except for my mother...
Has Sir another question?
What's on the first floor?
What's on the first floor?
The first floor is reserved for guests, sir. That is where sir will find his private rooms.
The main corridor leads around the building. Three stairways will enable sir to return to the ground floor.
It is also from there that sir will be able to reach the second floor.
Thank you very much.
Anything else, sir?
What is on the second floor?
Yes. What can I find on the second floor?
That floor is strictly reserved for Lord Mortimer, sir.
In the west wing on the second floor are his private chambers.
In the east wing are the rooms reserved for Lord Mortimer's personal guests.
At the moment, these rooms are reserved for Sir Holm, sir.
But only authorized guests may access that area.
Does sir have any more questions?
May I walk outside?
What is outside on the island exactly?
Lord Mortimer has made a point of keeping the main part of the island in its natural state, sir. For security reasons, only the wharves and the gardens are accessible to guests.
If sir would like to walk along the wharves, he has only to follow the pathway used upon his arrival.
If he would like to walk in the interior gardens of the manor, I would advise sir to pass through the Portrait Gallery.
May I help sir in any other way?
Return
I was wondering if you could help me out.
As I was unable to bring my personal effects with me, I was wondering if you could find me a few items?
Of course, sir. What would you require?
Would you have any Golden Elixir?
You wouldn't have a little Golden Elixir I could use, would you?
Oh, unfortunately, sir, I have orders not to give any of that medicine to any of Lord Mortimer's guests.
Some guests are here to follow a very strict treatment. Mixing or combining certain substances would be dangerous for sir.
No panic, I know what it is.
My good fellow, you're right. One should never mix treatments without the advice of an expert.
It so happens that I usually make my own Golden Elixir, but I haven't brought my kit with me.
Perhaps, in that case, would you fetch a spoonful of ethyl alcohol, ethereal oil, and ten millilitres of ethanol for me?
Along with that, a small quantity of gold, please. Just a few crumbs will suffice.
Ah, I see that sir knows his subject. Therefore I see no reason why I shouldn't give them to you.
I hope that will be enough for you sir, because I haven't any more.
Thank you, that will be fine.
May I help with anything else, sir?
It is not for consumption.
That's fine, I have no intention of swallowing this remedy.
You see, I generally use it to put the shine back on my shoes.
But maybe you'd rather I ask permission from Lord Mortimer?
Where is he? I'd like to tell him about my shoe problem.
Sir need do nothing of the sort. There is no reason to disturb Lord Mortimer with this small matter.
As you wish.
Here you are, sir. I hope sir will have enough with one bottle as I haven't any more.
Oh I'll make do. It's good of you to get this much.
May I do anything else for sir?
Return
Would you have any Maltese Cross?
Ah! I still haven't quite recovered after that boat crossing. Would you happen to have any Devil's Thorn, by any chance?
I...  I am sorry, sir, but the Devil's Thorn may be just a plant, but it is also a powerful psychotropic drug that causes undesirable diuretic effects.
I would advise against sir taking any.
I'll take full responsibility, give some to me.
Don't worry, my good man, I know the effects of Devil's Thorn very well.
I've been taking it for years without any adverse effects. I've never had cause to complain, you can believe me.
That is well, sir. Here is sir's herb.
What else can I do for you, sir?
It suffices to know how to take it.
You see, tribulus cistoides is from the zygophyllaceae family, very rich in nitrates and potassium chloride.
It was used in India seven hundred years before Christ, my good fellow. And I know nothing better to perk you up.
Oh! As sir wishes. Here is the herb, sir.
May I help you in anything else, sir?
Return
Would you have any Carmelite Water?
A little Carmelite Water would do me a lot of good, could you find me some, please?
Oh, the tonics are under lock and key, sir. Lord Mortimer only allows access to them in cases of emergency.
That's scandalous
What? That's the last straw!
Lord Mortimer himself asked me to take the sea to join him here. I accepted that out of kindness.
The voyage was undertaken in conditions that I prefer not to speak about.
And then, at long last I arrive and...  and you refuse me a simple flask of Carmelite Water?
No, sir...  I...  I...
Your name! Tell me your name!
Er, er, here, sir, your Carmelite Water. Please accept my sincerest apologies.
If sir requires anything else whatsoever, sir has only to ask.
Very well, it is a matter of urgency
Listen, I suffer from terrible migraines and the voyage by boat has brought on my rheumatism.
So, unless you have anything else to alleviate the pain, please give me some quickly. Thank you.
Oh and...  and the one from Bordeaux, right? I prefer it to the one from Paris.
Immediately, sir. Here. I hope sir will get well again quickly.
Anything else, sir?
Return
Have you got any amber?
My good fellow, would you have any amber available?
I would, but unfortunately I don't think I am authorized to give it out, sir. I believe it is a precious stone.
it has no value
Look, you aren't going to kick up a fuss about a vulgar piece of resin, are you?
Don't believe what they say about amber. It does nothing to warm up infants' bodies, let alone prevent toothache.
And neither does this fossil oleo-resin stimulate fertility, you can believe me.
Thank you for educating me, I didn't know. Here you are, sir.
Does sir desire anything else?
Bullshit and rob him
No point in lying, you know. I know full well you haven't got any.
I would never think of lying, sir, I don't believe I am authorized to give it away, that is all.
Amber, here? I'd be surprised...
Yet, I assure you, sir.
No, you're pulling my leg. I don't believe you.
I wouldn't dare to joke with sir.
Yeah, sure, you're just leading me on. I dare you to show it to me, if you really have some.
Well, then, sir, here is a piece.
Oh...  right. Well, I'm impressed. Can you lend it to me for a minute?
Of course, sir, here.
Wow, I can hardly believe it.
Well, I have other questions.
Of course, sir. But, sir, I believe you haven't given me back the amber, sir.
What? What amber?
The piece I gave to sir.
No, I don't know what you're talking about. You really ought to look after your things. It can't be easy to come across amber in these parts.
Ah...  errm...  well...  does sir desire anything else?
Return
Manuscript
What's that book you're hiding in your jacket?
The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe, sir. And I am not hiding it.
Hand it to me, please.
It is damaged, sir. I would never dare lend sir a book in such a pitiful state, sir. I took it to restore.
I'll take care of it.
Indeed, this masterpiece must not become more damaged.
Let me have it and I'll take care of it personally. I love antiquarian books.
It bothers me somewhat, it isn't sir's job to take care of it, really.
No, but I would love to. You'd be doing me a favor by letting me have it.
In that case, sir, I shall leave it in your care with pleasure.
May I do anything else for sir?
It's MY book!
Hang on...  but...  it's mine.
Beg pardon, sir?
It's my book! I'm telling you, it's my book!
With all due respect, sir, I hope sir will understand that I have doubts. You see, I found it in Lord Mortimer's library.
Huh, there you are then! That's exactly where I left it!
I am...  quite put out, sir, I...  don't know what to say.
In that case I suggest you say nothing and hand it over.
But...  I...
Now.
But Sir, I... Very well, sir. Here you are. May sir take good care of it, it is damaged.
And you've damaged it as well? Oh, bravo, bravo!
No, no, I didn't do anything, it wasn't me, sir.
Say pardon.
Pardon me, Sir.
Very good. There were some other things I wanted to go over with you.
Return
Return
Take your leave
What can I do for you, sir?
I am at your service, day and night, sir.
Ask about the sword.
Could you tell me where this sword comes from, please?
Certainly, Sir.
How did such a sword come into Sir's hands?
I'm the one asking the questions.
My good man, I'm afraid you're overstepping your role.
You're the one who's supposed to be giving the answers, not me.
(Louis points out to the servant that he ought to just keep to his duty.)
Naturally, I hope that Sir will forgive me.
I'm in a hurry!
Listen, my good man, I'd gladly stand here discussing matters all day long, but I'm terribly pressed for time.
Your petty logistical concerns are of no interest to me.
I asked you a question and I'm still waiting for an answer.
Do please excuse me, sir.
It's a lead to locate my mother.
I think the whole manor knows that Sarah de Richet has disappeared. And well, I'm on the case, so please give me an answer.
Very well, sir.
If I were Sir, I would look in the garden. This sword looks like it's from the garden statues.
And how can I get into the garden?
There are two ways, sir.
The first way to get to the garden is by the hall, between the conference room and the portrait gallery.
The second way is directly through the portrait gallery. Sir would just have to go out by the French windows.
Thank you, my good man.
What can you tell me about our host?
I would like you to speak about your master, Lord Mortimer.
Do please excuse me, sir, but I shall make no comment about my master.
Is there anything else that sir would like to know?
What can you tell me about the guests?
What can you tell me about the guests?
Do excuse me, sir, but I am bound by discretion to say nothing about Lord Mortimer's guests, sir.
Perhaps sir would like to know something else?
I have a few questions about the manor.
What can I find on the ground floor?
Yes. Can you briefly describe the ground floor, please?
Very well, sir.
On the ground floor, there are mainly living rooms.
Sir finds himself at present in the Grand Hall.
From the Grand Hall, sir can access, on one side, the Small Salon where the guests like to relax with a good book.
From there, sir can access the Conference Room, which is closed at present for preparations.
That is where Lord Mortimer likes to gather all of his guests for talks.
From the other side of the Grand Hall, sir may access the Dining Room.
That is where sir's meals will be served.
From the Dining Room, sir may benefit from an exceptional view overlooking the island.
It is also the best way to access the Portrait Gallery, where a large part of Lord Mortimer's works are exhibited.
And in the gallery, sir will also find access to the Garden.
But sir may be reassured, the building is accessible on both sides, so that it surrounds the Garden in question.

No, that doesn't work.
Well, at least one thing's for sure, this is definitely where the sword comes from!
No, that doesn't work.
Well, at least one thing's for sure, this is definitely where the sword comes from!
Theseus.
Son of Aegeus. He's the one who slayed the Minotaur.
Ah...  I think that's where the sword I found comes from. Looks like they've been carved from the same stone.
Theseus...  Who's that?
Ah, he's the son of Aegeus, he became the mythical King of Athens. The unifying king.
Pity he's generally only remembered for having slayed the Minotaur.
Translate the plaque
“Wrongly positioned, I am the blind hero”.
hmm...  I wasn't expecting an inscription like that.
Remember the legend.
I seem to recall he took the decision to confront the Minotaur... 
He killed the beast, but if it weren't for Ariadne's help, he would have been trapped in that labyrinth forever!
In short, yet another hero who wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Okay, okay, I'm...  I'm probably being a bit harsh, I mean, we do owe him the foundations of Athens. In other words, the Republic. “Render therefore unto Caesar what is Caesar's.”
Notice the crack
Looks like a crack has been made on his torso... 
Examine the crack
It's as long as a finger. I'd say between 6 and 8 centimeters.
Thrust the sword into the crack.
We will soon see... 
Return
Pull out the sword.
Let's try something else instead... 
Move away.
I wonder if Mother managed to solve this enigma...

Hmm, it reminds me of the statues in the garden.
I can't guarantee it but you ought to go and see, you never know, do you?
Thank you, Mr President.
You're quite welcome. See you soon.

Wonderful!
Isn't that lovely? Well, see you later.
I am quite happy to be at your disposal if you should need my help with anything at all.
