Ah, Louis. I've been expecting you. Thank you for joining us.
We are about to begin our conference.
Let me explain what is at stake.
Thank you kindly. But what do you expect of me exactly?
My mother's the one who was supposed to attend. Not me.
That is indeed what was initially intended.
Unfortunately, she still hasn't been found and my guests can't stay here indefinitely.
The conference must begin and it would be truly beneficial to the Order to join in the project. Consequently, I would like you to replace her during her absence.
What is at stake here is of the utmost importance.
It's important that the French Order gets their say.
And should you need any advice, don't worry, you are not alone, Louis.
Very well.
What is this conference about?
Can you give me a brief explanation of the aim of it all?
Of course, Louis. I was coming to that.
The aim of these meetings is to bring together the most influential people, in order to think together about the future.
But the future of who?
Of the world, Louis.
Our desire is to steer the destiny of our respective countries for the good of all and to no longer suffer the random hazards of History.
How does a conference work?
In concrete terms, how do you organize your discussions?
A conference is always organized the same way. There are two Masters of Ceremony who determine an important subject.
You and Sir Gregory, I presume.
Exactly.
We shall be the Masters of Ceremony.
It was our obligation to each bring to the table several guests, in order to debate a subject.
Once the debate is closed, a decision will be made by a vote of all the participants.
By a unanimous vote.
If the project is not agreed on by all, then it will be rejected.
And neither of the two masters of ceremony have the right to vote.
It's up to the guests alone to decide, Louis.
In other words, us.
Gregory and myself are merely the go-betweens.
Finally, if the project is validated, each guest goes home and starts working to make it happen.
It can take years.
More questions
Have you been operating for long?
How long have you been active?
Oh, this tradition has more or less always existed, Louis. It has continued from generation to generation.
Do you meet often?
Do you often hold this kind of society dinnerÂ ?
In general, once a year, but in actual fact it tends to be events that dictate our gatherings.
What major decisions have you already orchestrated?
Can you give me an example of an event that was decided here before being implemented in the outside world?
Well, take the French Revolution. It was decided right here two years before its implementation in France.
Concerning the case of the French Revolution, I wasn't invited, but as far as the American Revolution is concerned, Louis, I can testify that we planned it five years before implementing it, for example.
Go back
I have no more questions.
I have no more questions.
Louis, let me keep you a moment.
I would like to let you in on a secret before we begin, because I'm going to need your assistance.
You see, the project I'm going to present concerns the territory of Louisiana in North America.
It's currently Spanish territory, and I'm going to make the proposition to the assembly for it to become French.
What's that got to do with me?
But how does that concern me?
Well, you see, I prepared this project with your mother.
We began thinking about a crazy idea. Unfortunately, Sarah went missing before getting the bigger picture. I don't intend to stop at Louisiana.
Continue..
My idea is to increase the territory of the United States.
The first stone of this vast project consists of getting Spain to cede Louisiana to France.
Once it becomes French, France will hand it over to the United States, which will then allow them to double the size of their territory.
And that's where you come in.
France and the United States, hand in hand. Two democracies illuminating the world.
Where does his project extend?
Lord Mortimer, I'm sure you are aware that Louisiana is hardly prime quality land. I wouldn't be exaggerating to call it marshland.
How is acquiring land they won't know what to do with going to strengthen the United States?
Think further, Louis.
The United States won't stop there.
Once they've acquired Louisiana, nothing will stop them. All they would have to do then is keep pushing toward the west to take the whole North American continent.
So you intend to get rid of the Spanish.
They are purely transitory.
This is the settlers' home. It is natural for them to want to develop their Nation to become one of the greatest powers of this world.
As for the Spanish, there are just a handful of them actually on site and if need be, we'll see to it that they are sufficiently occupied in Europe so that their focus is not on the North American continent.
Moreover, Spain really only cares about its colonies in South America. It's hardly my fault if they are not capable of seeing the potential in the North American territories.
How far does his project go?
But why spread it over two phases?
Why not announce the overall project immediately?
Unfortunately, if Spain were to hear that the intention of all this is to allow the United States to grow, they would never sign.
Manuel Godoy is perfectly aware of President Washington's appetite. If the United States took Louisiana, Godoy would know full well that he will have lost the entire North American continent.
Things must take place in several stages, otherwise the change will be too brutal and he will have no choice but to reject the project.
I still don't see what I've got to do with it.
I understand, but what do you expect of me?
I want the Order's support.
I'm going to need allies to carry forth my project. In France as well as in all the countries where the Order operates.
Continue
The concept of royalty is from bygone times. It is time to lead the way to Democracy.
Take a look at them.
Apart from President Washington, they all belong to monarchies.
Do you really think they won't resist?
Of course they'll fight. Fearful as they are of losing their precious privileges.
But the world needs visionaries. Like you, like your mother.
It's a pity Sarah isn't here to see it. She only knew about a tiny part of the project.
I hope I can count on you, Louis.
It's time to start now, I must ask you to keep it to yourself for the time being.
Take a seat, follow the discussions, we'll have an opportunity to catch up later and you'll be able to let me know your thoughts.
Blast it, Mother, you didn't know about everything. His project is commendable. Why tell me to beware? Could you have gotten it wrong?
My friends, I propose we get started.
First of all, I would like to thank you for taking the time to come.
The honor is ours, my Lord.
As per our custom, here we are all together to discuss the face of tomorrow's world.
Even though there may be certain tensions between our nations, I must ask you to keep an open mind.
As Sarah de Richet is unable to be among us, please welcome Louis de Richet, who will represent the Golden Order and will vote on its behalf when the time comes.
Welcome among us, Louis.
Welcome, Monsieur de Richet..
I hope he'll be more effective than his mother regarding the protection of the King of France! The Order has proved particularly inefficient!
Come, Manuel, you're not going to spoil our visit.
The Order's mission was not to protect king Louis XVI, as far as I am aware.
We are talking about a King of divine blood, for goodness sake!
It seemed obvious to me he needed protecting. If the Golden Order wants to pride itself on being an influential organization, it should have kept him alive.
Thank them for their welcome.
Thank you all. I'm honored to be among you today. I will strive to represent the interests of the Order as best I can.
Put Godoy in his place
I'm sorry about the fate of the King of France, Duke Manuel.
However, I'm surprised at your remark...
How can a man like me have changed the course of things where a man like you, powerful, capable of influencing international politics, was unable to do any better.
Give a nod without saying anything
Perhaps we may begin, Lord Mortimer?
Certainly. I have a dream that our nations will continue to support each other. More now than ever before.
A dream that, for the sake of common good, we will do what it takes to ensure stability in the modern world.
I have a dream that we shall lead by example and ensure that the American territory may remain in peace.
Thank you for the thought, Lord Mortimer, but I don't see where you are leading.
I'm coming to it, Mr President.
William, I told you, you are moving too fast.
I need not remind you that North America is currently divided between the United States on the East coast...
And Spain, which occupies the remaining two thirds of the continent.
Well, I propose that Spain cedes the center of the continent to France, namely all of Louisiana.
Louisiana? But...
Well, it is not for sale!
Lord Mortimer, I sincerely hope I have not come all this way just to hear you ramble on about what Spain should and should not do.
When we went to all the trouble of gaining the territory a few years ago, it was not just to lose it today!
Have I made myself clear?
What did I tell you, William?
You speak of union and yet here you are, about to tear us apart.
Duke Manuel, I perfectly understand you.
But rest assured, you will soon adore my proposition, you shall see.
Well, since you give me the choice, my good fellow, allow me to doubt it.
However, I am impatient to hear what Spain could possibly gain from the sale of Louisiana.
I never spoke of a sale, my good fellow.
What... But... I... I do not understand...
There is one more territory left to conquer, if I'm not mistaken, in the North West.
It is of course occupied by your notorious Indians but...
We shall soon be rid of the savages, so that is not the question!
They are not savages!
Duke, these savages, as you call them, were there before you.
They are on their homeland.
As much as the black people of Africa, Monsieur de Richet.
That does not stop your dear France from massacring them and sending them like cattle to Mr Washington's cotton plantations to provide him with cheap labor.
So keep your morals to yourself, if you please.
SeÃ±or, I would not like to be associated with that.
The subject of black slaves in the United States of America is a complex subject which we shall resolve at a future date.
The filthy swine!
It obviously doesn't stop you from sleeping at night.
Not in the least.
Do not imagine I have anything against the American Indians or the blacks.
That is not the question. But business is business.
It is the natural order of things, Monsieur de Richet. There have always been men who govern other men. That is simply the way it is.
And it might as well be the likes of you who rule, is that right?
But of course.
Challenge him!
France is not without fault, but that doesn't take away Spain's responsibilities.
You see, native Americans are being subjected to a veritable ethnic cleansing. Europeans are colonizing their land so that it then belongs to them. The widespread evangelization of its inhabitants will soon eradicate a multitude of cultures.
You've done the same thing in South America.
How far will white people go? Reservations to pen them in like cattle? Total genocide?
France will soon no longer uses slavery!
SeÃ±or Godoy, you must know that France will soon ban these barbaric practices.
Oh, do not get on your high horse, Monsieur Frenchman.
The only reason why France has ceased trading in slaves is because of the commercial blockade that Great Britain has imposed against you.
The instant the shipping lanes have been restored, France will again treat these people like cattle.
Keep quiet
Come now, my friends, let us not digress.
Anyway, these primitive people have no souls, Louis. We bring the good word to them in order to save them.
You'll see, colonization brings with it many benefits, too.
Excuse me. If you don't mind, your Eminence, I shall continue.
Duke Manuel, I believe that Spain should cede Louisiana to France, free of charge.
This is utterly grotesque, Lord Mortimer.
What a strange example you set for your young protegÃ©.
Isn't that so, Monsieur de Richet? Do you understand anything of this proposition?
It would protect you from the Americans.
If I were you, SeÃ±or Godoy, I would think twice before stirring up a scandal.
I beg your pardon?!
Given the size of your colonies, you won't be able to keep them for long.
A number of countries are eyeing them as we speak. The United States would have no trouble taking them. For all intents and purposes you have no army in place.
By wanting to keep everything, you risk losing it all, especially your colonies in South America, which are far more valuable to you.
That is indeed the danger, Duke Manuel.
If it comes to war over Louisiana, you will lose. And probably a good deal more than you now imagine.
Young man, you are indeed a dark horse. Aren't you?
It will protect you from the British
We are neighbors, Duke Manuel.
Remenber your main rival in Europe is more likely to be England, who is plowing the seas right up your coastline!
Hand over Louisiana to France and make her a prime ally.
Come, Louis, Spain and Great Britain are already allies and have nothing to gain by breaking their alliance.
Even if I do agree, Duchess, the omnipresence of the English fleet in Atlantic waters does not particularly please me.
Say nothing
I must say, William, I find your project mostly disfavors me.
I thought you were my friend.
And I am, Mr President.
That is why I am doing everything in my power to calm your expansionist fervor.
France in Louisiana should persuade you not to attempt anything to take the territory by force.
Louisiana is a vast wetland where you would needlessly lose most of your troops. It would weaken you and offer certain nations the perfect opportunity to take back your famous United States.
I am protecting you from yourself, George. Trust me.
I understand but with friends like you, sir, I certainly don't need any more enemies.
I hope you know what you're doing...
Checked
Am I imagining things or does it look like Washington isn't aware of Mortimer's plan?
Not to put too fine a point on it, Lord Mortimer, but I doubt the Holy See would be in favor of catholic Louisiana being handed over to secular revolutionaries and king killers.
I should think Monsieur de Richet has an opinion on the subject, has he not?
France will protect the Christians.
Your Eminence, have no fear over that. I am sure France will do everything in its power to protect the Christians of Louisiana.
My young friend, how can you come out with such a remark after the discussion we had on the evening of your arrival?
If France was so respectful of worship, it would not be bleeding priests as it is doing at this very moment in time.
Don't be naive. This is politics. The Holy See must be concerned at seeing such a large territory falling into the hands of the French.
France does not need to seek the Pope's opinion.
If France took the Papal States, their opinion over the sale of Louisiana would be definitively resolved.
Good Lord... you are talking of an invasion of Italy.
Don't take it the wrong way, your Eminence, colonization brings with it many benefits, you'll see.
Very funny, Monsieur de Richet.
Think of Mortimer's maps of the world.
On the maps of Italy I saw in Mortimer's secret study, he had anticipated movements of troops across Italy.
I wouldn't be surprised if he is planning an invasion of Italy by France. And if I push the notion a bit further, I can well imagine that Bonaparte's cannons financed by the Order will be used for that purpose.
The noose is tightening around poor Piaggi's neck without him even realizing it...
I don't know if I'm the best person to speak about that, your Eminence.
Italy could be invaded
Well, I think that the French army will enter Italy, and that the Vatican will do whatever France demands of it, if the Vatican wants to retain its place.
You are joking, I hope!
Lord Mortimer, I did not come here to listen to such nonsense!
What makes you think that, Monsieur de Richet?
Well, monsieur Bonaparte, here present, has ordered a large number of cannons and I wouldn't be surprised if they were to be used to keep Italy under control.
Come, sir, what a strange idea!
I have enough on my plate with issues in Corsica.
But Corsica is not where the cannons are to be delivered. Is it?
Ah, Louis, you are quick-witted. I like you!
You seem to be overlooking something, messieurs les FranÃ§ais. I also have backers who would be only too pleased to demonstrate the full extent of their fervor by defending the Vatican.
Claim not to know
Honestly, your eminence, I really don't see it that way.
Say nothing
Mi auguro che insegnerete l educazione a questo giovanotto presuntuoso, sir Gregory
Checked
"I hope that you will teach this pretentious young man some manners, Sir Gregory."
It looks like I won't be just making friends here.
In any case, my Lord, I doubt the English crown will agree.
Ich versichere Ihnen, Emily. Nie PreuÃen wird diese Vereinbarung akzeptieren.
Checked
"I assure you, Emily. The Prussian will never accept this agreement."
WÃ¶llner looks like he's set on ruining Mortimer's plan.
Duchess, I am persuaded that we shall find a common ground.
That's enough William!
These are grave times. We don't care about the fate of Louisiana. That worthless expanse of putrid swamps interests no one but yourself.
Speak for yourself, my friend!
Hold on there, Mr. Royal Gigolo, lower the volume and let Sir Gregory finish!
Checked
Holm, Godoy, and now WÃ¶llner.
Mortimer's adversaries are ready to tear each other to pieces... and he takes a malicious pleasure watching it happen...
How dare you!...
Gentlemen, let us try to remain calm!
There you are, William!
See where your projects have taken us, as per usual! Chaos!
That's enough, I'm tired! We shall continue this discussion tomorrow but please be aware that your project will never be ratified!
Those who are opposed to this project, follow me!
Are you coming with us, Monsieur de Richet?
Come, Gregory, I think Louis would rather stay.
Wouldn't you, Louis?
Stay to assist Mortimer
As for me, I think I shall remain with Lord Mortimer, Sir Gregory.
You are committing a grave error, Louis.
Time will tell.
Leave to assist Holm
At the risk of displeasing you, my Lord, I'd rather follow Sir Gregory.
I don't think this is a place for the Order.
Louis? No...
Let him go, Mr President.
Everyone is free to choose.
Ah, Louis. I've been expecting you. Thank you for joining us.
We are about to begin our conference.
Let me explain what is at stake.

I hope you know what you're doing...
Checked
Am I imagining things or does it look like Washington isn't aware of Mortimer's plan?
Not to put too fine a point on it, Lord Mortimer, but I doubt the Holy See would be in favor of catholic Louisiana being handed over to secular revolutionaries and king killers.
I should think Monsieur de Richet has an opinion on the subject, has he not?
France will protect the Christians.
Your Eminence, have no fear over that. I am sure France will do everything in its power to protect the Christians of Louisiana.
My young friend, how can you come out with such a remark after the discussion we had on the evening of your arrival?
If France was so respectful of worship, it would not be bleeding priests as it is doing at this very moment in time.
Don't be naive. This is politics. The Holy See must be concerned at seeing such a large territory falling into the hands of the French.
France does not need to seek the Pope's opinion.
If France took the Papal States, their opinion over the sale of Louisiana would be definitively resolved.
Good Lord... you are talking of an invasion of Italy.
Don't take it the wrong way, your Eminence, colonization brings with it many benefits, you'll see.
Very funny, Monsieur de Richet.
Think of Mortimer's maps of the world.
On the maps of Italy I saw in Mortimer's secret study, he had anticipated movements of troops across Italy.
I wouldn't be surprised if he is planning an invasion of Italy by France. And if I push the notion a bit further, I can well imagine that Bonaparte's cannons financed by the Order will be used for that purpose.
The noose is tightening around poor Piaggi's neck without him even realizing it...
I don't know if I'm the best person to speak about that, your Eminence.
Well, I think that the French army will enter Italy, and that the Vatican will do whatever France demands of it, if the Vatican wants to retain its place.
You are joking, I hope!
Lord Mortimer, I did not come here to listen to such nonsense!
What makes you think that, Monsieur de Richet?
Well, monsieur Bonaparte, here present, has ordered a large number of cannons and I wouldn't be surprised if they were to be used to keep Italy under control.
Come, sir, what a strange idea!
I have enough on my plate with issues in Corsica.
But Corsica is not where the cannons are to be delivered. Is it?
Ah, Louis, you are quick-witted. I like you!
You seem to be overlooking something, messieurs les FranÃ§ais. I also have backers who would be only too pleased to demonstrate the full extent of their fervor by defending the Vatican.
Claim not to know
Honestly, your eminence, I really don't see it that way.
Say nothing
Mi auguro che insegnerete l educazione a questo giovanotto presuntuoso, sir Gregory
Checked
"I hope that you will teach this pretentious young man some manners, Sir Gregory."
It looks like I won't be just making friends here.
In any case, my Lord, I doubt the English crown will agree.
Ich versichere Ihnen, Emily. Nie PreuÃen wird diese Vereinbarung akzeptieren.
Checked
"I assure you, Emily. The Prussian will never accept this agreement."
WÃ¶llner looks like he's set on ruining Mortimer's plan.
Duchess, I am persuaded that we shall find a common ground.
That's enough William!
These are grave times. We don't care about the fate of Louisiana. That worthless expanse of putrid swamps interests no one but yourself.
Speak for yourself, my friend!
Holn on there, Mr. Royal Gigolo, lower the volume and let Sir Gregory finish!
Checked
Holm, Godoy, and now WÃ¶llner.
Mortimer's adversaries are ready to tear each other to pieces... and he takes a malicious pleasure watching it happen...
How dare you!...
Gentlemen, let us try to remain calm!
There you are, William!
See where your projects have taken us, as per usual! Chaos!
That's enough, I'm tired! We shall continue this discussion tomorrow but please be aware that your project will never be ratified!
Those who are opposed to this project, follow me!
Are you coming with us, Monsieur de Richet?
Come, Gregory, I think Louis would rather stay.
Wouldn't you, Louis?
Stay to assist Mortimer
As for me, I think I shall remain with Lord Mortimer, Sir Gregory.
You are committing a grave error, Louis.
Time will tell.
Leave to assist Holm
At the risk of displeasing you, my Lord, I'd rather follow Sir Gregory.
I don't think this is a place for the Order.
Louis? No...
Let him go, Mr President.
Everyone is free to choose.
Please go and see Lord Mortimer, so that we may finally begin!
Good evening, gentlemen,
Are we ready? The much-awaited conference is about to begin?
That is what we have all been waiting for.
I believe that Lord Mortimer wishes to speak to you before it begins.
You should go and see him.
Make haste, de Richet. Mortimer's waiting for you.
I don't know if you ever found what you were looking for in the garden, but Mortimer is waiting for you.
I suggest you get a move on.
You say it as if you were afraid of him.
What's going on between them two?
I sense that you have things you'd like to say but something's holding you back.
What is going on between you two?
Nothing...
Absolutely nothing.
I believed in him. I followed him to the best of my ability. I championed his ideas, defended his decisions. And then, without even realizing it, I became lost.
The siren's song, Monsieur de Richet!
You wake up one morning, not knowing where you are, and you think about everything you've done, for a man who wasn't even worth it.
For a man who has no respect for you. Who uses you, and who drops you as soon as he no longer needs you.
For me, it's too late now. But you, you still have a choice.
Don't respond to his call, sir.
What is he so afraid of?
What frightens you so much about him?
Hurry up, he's waiting for you.
Leave
My son, glad you're here. It seems Lord Mortimer's been waiting for you to arrive before beginning.
What a pity your mother isn't here for the conference.
I hope I'll be able to see her before I leave. I still have a very important letter to give to her.
Feeling alright, Louis?
You look like you're miles away.
Everything's fine, don't worry.
Lord Mortimer wants to talk to you, Louis. Don't make him wait.
My friends, the conference is about to begin.
Please excuse me if I troubled you last night with my project.
I understand that you might well have a few questions to ask.
As you know, the final vote will be cast in a few days. This morning's aim is to answer your questions and check the temperature of your respective positions, so that we may reach a greater understanding.
As always, Lord Mortimer.
We parted in perfect disagreement, my Lord.
Where would you like us to take it from?
Come, sir, please let William believe he still has a chance of winning us over.  Otherwise his imprecations will lack panache and we shall be bored stiff.
Oh, let me reassure you, I am convinced that a good night's sleep has brought sound advice, and that this morning will be even more interesting.
Therefore, I would like to go round the table in order to hear everyone's first impressions.
Well, I am still firmly AGAINST it. Even though my choice won't count.
AGAINST
AGAINST
AGAINST
And you, Duke Manuel?
AGAINST, of course!
Well, you see... it is more complicated than... it...er...
Godoy!
Come, Gregory, don't try to impress my guests, please.
They are not YOUR guests!
Gregory!
Anyone under my roof is, by definition, MY guest.
You included.
I would be very grateful if you would let MY guests speak. Duke Manuel, you were saying you still had some doubts?
Well, you see, the situation has changed since last night.
What's going on here, my Lord Duke?
You see, I gave it some thought during the night. New arguments have come to light.
After a discussion with Monsieur de Richet, last night, I've decided that Spain will join the coalition against France and will go to war as soon as I get back!
I am a man of conviction and of honor! And the way that Monsieur de Richet came to me to manipulate me into joining your side, Lord Mortimer, is unacceptable!
Furthermore, I refuse categorically your project about Louisiana!
You reap what you sow, William...
I do not believe that Monsieur de Richet meant to upset you but you have every right to react in this way.
What do you mean, Duke Manuel?
Sir Gregory, I regret to inform you that Spain will not support you in this operation.
I vote FOR!
Moreover, in response to arguments brought to my attention, I declare war on France!
What?? What is he doing?
If you think France is afraid of you, you are dreaming!
Over ten nations rise against you, young man, and you behave like a yapping little dog?
When the French armies are at your door, my Lord Duke, you will change your tune!
Well, as for me, I am FOR Lord Mortimer's project.
Despite Duchess Hillsborrow's overwhelmingly convincing nocturnal attentions.
What?! So, Emily was playing at trying to win over guests last night?
It was nothing more than a friendly little chat, of course.
How could it be otherwise ?
And by the way, remember me to your husband when you see him.
And you, President Washington, what is your position?
FOR, of course.
FOR, of course.
And I will add for your benefit, Sir Gregory, that next time you send someone to try to persuade me to change sides, choose someone with a minimum of experience.
Oh, I won't forget, Mr President.
Well, you see, Monsieur Bonaparte, I would rather you'd have forgotten me for a minute.
William, I am sorry but I cannot follow you this time.
George ?! What...?
I am AGAINST, William. Please excuse me.
I cannot commit the United States to such an enterprise. It's just too risky.
Well, that leaves just yourself and Monsieur PÃ©ru, Louis.
You're all making me sick!
Look at yourselves!
What?
You are pathetic!
Have you been drinking or what?
There you are quibbling away, "My Lord Duke" this and "Madame Duchess" that...
You know very well that we're nothing but puppets on a damned string!
Jacques, really!...
Let's end the charade! It's over!
Jacques...
My Lord...
Thank you for everything you've done for me over the years.
But it didn't come for free, and now I see the price is too high to pay.
I'll stop...
Come, Jacques, we'll talk it over.
No, I'm finished. I want my freedom back, my Lord. I shall no longer work for you.
INTERVENE
DON'T INTERVENE
I've had enough of your money, your influence, your power!
I want my freedom back! I want my damn life back!

If you're the one who did it, mother, it couldn't have been easy with only one hand!

I must have just missed her.
If only I hadn't wasted so much time getting out of Lord Mortimer's study.
Leave it.

What the hell has been going on here?
Examine the body
Somebody smashed him in the back of the head with something.
He slowly bled to death...
But that isn't what killed him...  They broke his neck.
Search
Look under the mask
Let's see what secret's hidden under these masks...
His face doesn't ring a bell. I'm a bit disappointed.
I'd have expected more from Lord Mortimer!
Move away
Mother, if this is your doing, the situation is getting worse and worse!

So, you've come at last.
Easy...
Let me turn around...
Oh my God, Mother, what has happened to you?
Who are you?
What? But...  Mother...
Who...  ARE YOU?
It's me! Louis...  your son.
No, you lie!
You won't catch me out like that...  Louis...  Louis isn't here.
He obeys his mother...  He would never have come here.
Mother, I don't know what you've been through, but...
...lower your arm...
Please.
You think I was born yesterday, do you?
But it won't work!
I'm begging you...
One day, you will fall...
Mother...
Why are you here?
I'm here for her.
I came for you.
Oh, I don't doubt that for a second. But you will never get me!
What do you mean?... You don't understand, I wasn't threatening you at all!
Lord Mortimer wrote to me
I received a letter from Lord Mortimer inviting me...
THAT'S ENOUGH!
You want to corrupt us all... One after the other...
But you will never get me!
I am here to save her
I'm here to help you.
You have nothing to fear.
If only it were so simple...
Remind her about the quest of the Book
Remember Al Azif?
I was sure...
Where is the book, Mother?
So that's what you want... Well you will never find it.
Emily died for that !
What's got into her?
It's time to go home, Mother.
Let's go, Mother...  Let's go home.
In all my heart, there's nothing I want more...
But I know you won't let me leave...
You are evil incarnate.
Every word that comes out of your...  mouth...  is sharper than a razor blade.
I don't wish you any harm, really, mother!
It's me...  Louis!
DON'T SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HIM!!
YOU WILL NEVER GET HIM!!
Mother, stop torturing yourself.
It really is me, Louis. How can I convince you?
If you really are who you say you are, what was the saying I taught you?
You've been telling it to me since I was three years old, Mother. How can I ever forget it?
Always keep your mind rational...
And open
Open
And open
Right, well...  and open
... and open
You knew it...  You are smart...
You're getting me muddled up! Tell me rather...
Whose place were we at when I told you I was coming here?
Mother, I really am your son. You can't trick me!
We were in Paris, we were investigating an art dealer.
His name?
Von Bolchet
His name was... von... von Bolchet!
Louis would never have got it wrong, dirtbag!
Von Botcher
His name was von... Botcher.
You just made your first mistake, scumbag!
Von Morchert
His name was von... von Morchert.
Wrong!
Von Bolcher
I think he was called von Bolcher.
You think so?... Wrong.
Louis would never have gotten it wrong.
Von Borchert
I just told you, you can't trick me.
His name was von Borchert.
No no, wait, it's... it's just a detail... he...
He lived in Paris, near the Note-Dame Cathedral. We investigated him for three months.
He made a fortune by taking advantage of gullible collectors of Parisian high society.
You're a good actor...
He was an ancient art dealer.
He had the BOOK!! AL Azif!!
And that's what you wanted to get out of me, wasn't it?...
Not at all!
We unmasked him but then he came after us.
We escaped but you didn't want me to intervene.
That's how I got this scar.
I listened to you and we knocked him out.
What...  how?... You can't know about that...
L... Louis, No... I... Is it... Is it really you?...
My God, everything is lost then...
I refuse to believe it's really you, Louis.
Otherwise...  all this would be for nothing.
Mother, I... I don't know what happened to you, but don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
I'm here for you and...
No!... I ordered you not to come with me!
I received a letter and...
Lord Mortimer informed me of your disappearance.
So I took the...
No, no, NO!
... it's not true, it's a nightmare...  don't tell me that...
Have you spoken to him?
Oh shit...  she's completely panicked because I spoke to Mortimer.
It seems she's afraid of what he might have said to me about her...
DID HE SPEAK TO YOU?
Of course.
Naturally. Even though I had to wait three days for him to see me, we met only this morning.
You've been here for the past three days?...
Yes, why?
Is she afraid of what he might have said about Adams?
Mother, I don't know what you're imaging.
But don't worry, everything will be alright.
If you're worried about what I might think about Elizabeth Adams, honestly...
Oh Louis, Elizabeth is the last of my worries right now!
I did what I could for her but it was too late.
He wasn't here when I arrived.
Don't believe it! I... I thought I'd meet him the moment I arrived, given the situation.
But not at all! He didn't even bother to meet me in person!
I imagine that Elizabeth was still here...
Very well...
Rational and open, Louis...
Since you arrived on the island, has anything strange happened to you?
Depends on what you mean by "strange".
Finding my mother with one hand less?
Personally, I think that you being missing for three days and then me finding you underground minus a hand, well, that qualifies as strange, don't you think?
No! My hand is not important for the moment!
If that's the only thing you've found that shocks you, then all is well.
Elizabeth's murder?
Does the savage murder of the secret daughter of president Washington's good friend count as being strange?
What? So Elizabeth is dead?
Stabbed several times.
Don't you think it's time you told me what's happened to you?
I...  no...  not now.
Like finding out about your past with Elizabeth?
Do you want to tell me about your relationship with Elizabeth Adams?
Louis, I don't know what you've found out but just know that I did everything I could to help her!
I believe you.
I'm sure you did, Mother. I'm not judging you.
You know, what she had to put up with was slowly gnawing away at her.
That's unacceptable, Mother.
How can you say that, Mother?
I saw the scars, the tattoos...
You weren't there and you don't know what that child suffered everyday!
The voices in her head?
You mean the voices that she claimed to hear?
Look, this is neither the place nor the time to speak about it!
Having visions?
Like me having visions, for example?
I knew it! It's started...  Oh, Louis, I just wish...
Hell, she's panicking...
Yes, it's happened to me. Like when I was a boy.
I find myself in someone else's body for the space of a dream.
Have you ever dreamed of a different place to the one where you were sleeping?
Without being able to explain it?
No.
But Mother, don't worry. I'm not losing my mind, everything is fine.
You used to give me a concoction to calm me down when I was little. So just make some for me once we get back home.
Migraines? Loss of consciousness? Loss of control?
No, no, rest assured. All is well...
I promise you.
What else?
Mortimer's secret study?
Everything I found in Lord Mortimer's secret study.
You managed to get past the nightmare?...
I'm proud of you, Louis.
But that's not what I meant by strange.
He's nevertheless extending his influence across the world, Mother.
I know, but that's not what concerns me right now!
I asked you if anything strange has happened to you, personally.
GOOD OUTCOME
Now, shut up and listen to me. We might still have a chance.
Something of utmost importance is going to play out right here.
What are you talking about?
A conference, Louis.
I should think all Mortimer's guests have arrived by now, haven't they?
Yes, they have, since this morning.
Perfect.
The conference will be able to begin.
Very soon, I should think.
Indeed, it shouldn't be long and...
Let me finish! We haven't time!
Say nothing
You will attend this conference and you must find out what Mortimer is up to!
Don't trust him, Louis!
Understood?
Does she know about the project?
But... but what's it about?
No matter! I'd wager it's about a vast acquisition of some territory in North America.
This, however, is not the issue.
But don't you think that...
Agree without trying to understand.
Right, I'll do what you ask of me.
But calm down, please, Mother.
Say nothing
Louis, I made a mistake by coming here!
We are in the lion's den.
What?
What do you mean?
Say nothing
Mortimer...  Holm...  their guests. Watch what happens.
Do you think it's normal that the representatives of the most powerful nations are here all on their own without anyone else...
...on an island in the middle of nowhere, in total secrecy?
No, not really but...
Louis...  They shape the world. They manipulate us.
Everything is decided here...  and now.
They create and break states, provoke wars, destitute governments or decide who will be their leaders.
Open your eyes!
What is she talking about?
Mother, calm yourself, please...
Say nothing
Nothing is impossible for them. They are capable of reaching everyone, wherever they may be.
Through high society banquets, they model the future of us all.
A cardinal from the Vatican drinks to the health of the Prussian minister of worship.
Who, as we speak, is exterminating all the Christians in Prussia.
And it isn't at all an issue for them.
And?...  What do you propose?
It's time to act, my son.
You will go to this conference and, from the inside, you'll do everything you can to prevent Mortimer's plan from going ahead smoothly.
We can talk later. I'll explain everything.
But why?
Do as I say, Louis! It's of the utmost importance! Beware of Mortimer. He won't let anything stand in his way.
You promise me that after...
Yes, after!
Go now.
Yes, Mother, I'm going, I'm going...
BAD OUTCOME
If you really are who you say you are, then you'll do what I ask of you!
Which is?
A conference is going to be held.
You will attend on my behalf.
No, wait, Mother...  No one cares about...
Shut up, Louis!
You will be invited and you will go.
Mortimer will present a project. Whatever this project is...
But...
WHATEVER THE PROJECT IS, I want you to learn as much as you can about it.
You'll have to get by as best you can, but we must find out what it's about.
Do you understand?
Don't you think that before all that, there are a few issues to be addressed?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
Yeess, alright, alright, I understand!
I'll explain afterward!
But right now, you MUST go to the conference.
Go now.
You do realize you're still treating me like a...
Go!
If you aren't there when I get back, I warn you...
One more thing, Mother...
Emily Hillsborrow, Emma's sister, came to this island looking for her sister...
She probably won't hesitate to take revenge and...
It's the signal that the conference is starting, Louis.
Don't be concerned about the Duchess, she's the last of our worries.
Don't move...
Wait, I don't...
So, you've come at last.
Easy...
Let me turn around...
Oh my God, Mother, what has happened to you?
Who are you?
What? But...  Mother...
Who...  ARE YOU?
It's me! Louis...  your son.
No, you lie!
You won't catch me out like that...  Louis...  Louis isn't here.
He obeys his mother...  He would never have come here.
Mother, I don't know what you've been through, but...
...lower your arm...
Please.
You think I was born yesterday, do you?
But it won't work!
I'm begging you...
One day, you will fall...
Mother...
Why are you here?
I'm here for her.
I came for you.
Oh, I don't doubt that for a second. But you will never get me!
What do you mean?... You don't understand, I wasn't threatening you at all!
Lord Mortimer wrote to me
I received a letter from Lord Mortimer inviting me...
THAT'S ENOUGH!

You have nothing to fear.
If only it were so simple...
Remind her about the quest of the Book
Remember Al Azif?
I was sure...
Where is the book, Mother?
So that's what you want... Well you will never find it.
Emily died for that !
What's got into her?
It's time to go home, Mother.
Let's go, Mother...  Let's go home.
In all my heart, there's nothing I want more...
But I know you won't let me leave...
You are evil incarnate.
Every word that comes out of your...  mouth...  is sharper than a razor blade.
I don't wish you any harm, really, mother!
It's me...  Louis!
DON'T SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HIM!!
YOU WILL NEVER GET HIM!!
Mother, stop torturing yourself.
It really is me, Louis. How can I convince you?
If you really are who you say you are, what was the saying I taught you?
You've been telling it to me since I was three years old, Mother. How can I ever forget it?
Always keep your mind logical...
And open
Open
And open
Right, well...  and open
... and open
You knew it...  You are smart...
You're getting me muddled up! Tell me rather...
Whose place were we at when I told you I was coming here?
Mother, I really am your son. You can't trick me!
We were in Paris, we were investigating an art dealer.
His name?
Von Bolchet
His name was... von... von Bolchet!
Louis would never have got it wrong, dirtbag!
Von Botcher
His name was von... Botcher.
You just made your first mistake, scumbag!
Von Morchert
His name was von... von Morchert.
Wrong!
Von Bolcher
I think he was called von Bolcher.
You think so?... Wrong.
Louis would never have gotten it wrong.
Von Borchert
I just told you, you can't trick me.
His name was von Borchert.
No no, wait, it's... it's just a detail... he...
He lived in Paris, near the Note-Dame Cathedral. We investigated him for three months.
He made a fortune by taking advantage of gullible collectors of Parisian high society.
You're a good actor...
He was an ancient art dealer.
He had the BOOK!! AL Azif!!
And that's what you wanted to get out of me, wasn't it?...
Not at all!
We unmasked him but then he came after us.
We escaped but you didn't want me to intervene.
That's how I got this scar.
I listened to you and we knocked him out.
What...  how?... You can't know about that...
L... Louis, No... I... Is it... Is it really you?...
My God, everything is lost then...
I refuse to believe it's really you, Louis.
Otherwise...  all this would be for nothing.
Mother, I... I don't know what happened to you, but don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
I'm here for you and...
No!... I ordered you not to come with me!
I received a letter and...
Lord Mortimer informed me of your disappearance.
So I took the...
No, no, NO!
... it's not true, it's a nightmare...  don't tell me that...
Have you spoken to him?
Oh shit...  she's completely panicked because I spoke to Mortimer.
It seems she's afraid of what he might have said to me about her...
DID HE SPEAK TO YOU?
Of course.
Naturally. Even though I had to wait three days for him to see me, we met only this morning.
You've been here for the past three days?...
Yes, why?
Is she afraid of what he might have said about Adams?
Mother, I don't know what you're imaging.
But don't worry, everything will be alright.
If you're worried about what I might think about Elizabeth Adams, honestly...
Oh Louis, Elizabeth is the last of my worries right now!
I did what I could for her but it was too late.
He wasn't here when I arrived.
Don't believe it! I... I thought I'd meet him the moment I arrived, given the situation.
But not at all! He didn't even bother to meet me in person!
I imagine that Elizabeth was still here...
Very well...
Rational and open, Louis...
Since you arrived on the island, has anything strange happened to you?
Depends on what you mean by "strange".
Finding my mother with one hand less?
Personally, I think that you being missing for three days and then me finding you underground minus a hand, well, that qualifies as strange, don't you think?
No! My hand is not important for the moment!
If that's the only thing you've found that shocks you, then all is well.
Elizabeth's murder?
Does the savage murder of the secret daughter of president Washington's good friend count as being strange?
What? So Elizabeth is dead?
Stabbed several times.
Don't you think it's time you told me what's happened to you?
I...  no...  not now.
Like finding out about your past with Elizabeth?
Do you want to tell me about your relationship with Elizabeth Adams?
Louis, I don't know what you've found out but just know that I did everything I could to help her!
I believe you.
I'm sure you did, Mother. I'm not judging you.
You know, what she had to put up with was slowly gnawing away at her.
That's unacceptable, Mother.
How can you say that, Mother?
I saw the scars, the tattoos...
You weren't there and you don't know what that child suffered everyday!
The voices in her head?
You mean the voices that she claimed to hear?
Look, this is neither the place nor the time to speak about it!
Having visions?
Like me having visions, for example?
I knew it! It's started...  Oh, Louis, I just wish...
Hell, she's panicking...
Yes, it's happened to me. Like when I was a boy.
I find myself in someone else's body for the space of a dream.
Have you ever dreamed of a different place to the one where you were sleeping?
Without being able to explain it?
No.
But Mother, don't worry. I'm not losing my mind, everything is fine.
You used to give me a concoction to calm me down when I was little. So just make some for me once we get back home.
Migraines? Loss of consciousness? Loss of control?
No, no, rest assured. All is well...
I promise you.
What else?
Mortimer's secret study?
Everything I found in Lord Mortimer's secret study.
You managed to get past the nightmare?...
I'm proud of you, Louis.
But that's not what I meant by strange.
He's nevertheless extending his influence across the world, Mother.
I know, but that's not what concerns me right now!
I asked you if anything strange has happened to you, personally.
GOOD OUTCOME
Now, shut up and listen to me. We might still have a chance.
Something of utmost importance is going to play out right here.
What are you talking about?
A conference, Louis.
I should think all Mortimer's guests have arrived by now, haven't they?
Yes, they have, since this morning.
Perfect.
The conference will be able to begin.
Very soon, I should think.
Indeed, it shouldn't be long and...
Let me finish! We haven't time!
Say nothing
You will attend this conference and you must find out what Mortimer is up to!
Don't trust him, Louis!
Understood?
Does she know about the project?
But... but what's it about?
No matter! I'd wager it's about a vast acquisition of some territory in North America.
This, however, is not the issue.
But don't you think that...
Agree without trying to understand.
Right, I'll do what you ask of me.
But calm down, please, Mother.
Say nothing
Louis, I made a mistake by coming here!
We are in the lion's den.
What?
What do you mean?
Say nothing
Mortimer...  Holm...  their guests. Watch what happens.
Do you think it's normal that the representatives of the most powerful nations are here all on their own without anyone else...
...on an island in the middle of nowhere, in total secrecy?
No, not really but...
Louis...  They shape the world. They manipulate us.
Everything is decided here...  and now.
They create and break states, provoke wars, destitute governments or decide who will be their leaders.
Open your eyes!
What is she talking about?
Mother, calm yourself, please...
Say nothing
Nothing is impossible for them. They are capable of reaching everyone, wherever they may be.
Through high society banquets, they model the future of us all.
A cardinal from the Vatican drinks to the health of the Prussian minister of worship.
Who, as we speak, is exterminating all the Christians in Prussia.
And it isn't at all an issue for them.
And?...  What do you propose?
It's time to act, my son.
You will go to this conference and, from the inside, you'll do everything you can to prevent Mortimer's plan from going ahead smoothly.
We can talk later. I'll explain everything.
But why?
Do as I say, Louis! It's of the utmost importance! Beware of Mortimer. He won't let anything stand in his way.
You promise me that after...
Yes, after!
Go now.
Yes, Mother, I'm going, I'm going...
BAD OUTCOME
If you really are who you say you are, then you'll do what I ask of you!
Which is?
A conference is going to be held.
You will attend on my behalf.
No, wait, Mother...  No one cares about...
Shut up, Louis!
You will be invited and you will go.
Mortimer will present a project. Whatever this project is...
But...
WHATEVER THE PROJECT IS, I want you to learn as much as you can about it.
You'll have to get by as best you can, but we must find out what it's about.
Do you understand?
Don't you think that before all that, there are a few issues to be addressed?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
Yeess, alright, alright, I understand!
I'll explain afterward!
But right now, you MUST go to the conference.
Go now.
You do realize you're still treating me like a...
Go!
If you aren't there when I get back, I warn you...
One more thing, Mother...
Emily Hillsborrow, Emma's sister, came to this island looking for her sister...
She probably won't hesitate to take revenge and...
It's the signal that the conference is starting, Louis.
Don't be concerned about the Duchess, she's the last of our worries.
I reassured Sarah de Richet
I did not reassure Sarah de Richet

"Lord Duke,
Here is the information obtained by our intelligence service.
I can confirm that Mr Hay is indeed working on an agreement with Great Britain.
The aim seems to be to weaken the French economy, and secretly that of the Spanish, by seizing merchandise at sea.
Our treasuries are already suffering from the embargo on French food products, such a treaty would mean the ruin of our colonies.
I have no doubt that you will be able to swiftly find a diplomatic solution.
Awaiting further instructions... "

Duke Manuel?
Well, well, Monsieur de Richet. I was not expecting you.
I am not in the mood, sir, I warn you.
What do you want from me, sir?
Ask why was he angry when he arrived
I see you are still feeling under pressure.
Since your arrival, I've noticed that you have been on the defensive.
...
It seems to me that Monsieur PÃ©ru has a knack for getting your back up.
That's the least you can say.
Indeed, I was warned. I knew what to expect.
For God's sake, why in the hell did your people execute their King? Have the French gone stark, raving mad?
There are nothing but monarchies in power in Europe: they will all come crashing down on you!!
We shall see: it might well turn out to be the opposite...
Huh... You certainly don't lack for audacity, young man!
Rally him to Mortimer.
Duke Manuel, I've come to talk. A distinguished man like yourself will not let a small disagreement get in the way of progress.
I am convinced that we can come to an arrangement that will satisfy all parties. Lord Mortimer's project could be beneficial for everyone.
How dare you stand here before me after that conference!
Never will I follow France, monsieur.
Never!
Remind him of our countries' common interests.
You and I both serve our countries as best we can, Duke Manuel. We are ambassadors.
That doesn't mean we have to oppose each other. France and Spain have always been neighbors and friends.
We share common issues and it is not in our interest to come into conflict. Let alone on our own home soil.
Alright, you have my full attention, Monsieur de Richet.
Make good use of it.
I've come to get some fresh air.
Oh nothing in particular, seÃ±or.
It's a beautiful night, I've come for a breath of fresh air before going to bed.
When you've stopped taking me for a fool, maybe you will tell me what you are really doing here?
WÃ¶llner is looking for you.
I've come to warn you that WÃ¶llner is looking for you.
For what reason?
Ah, that I don't know, he didn't say.
Well, he can wait.
Thank you, sir.
About our spat at the conference...
This conference can't have been easy for you.
Is it always like this?
Ha! That's the least we can say!
Yet, I was warned: I knew what to expect from Mortimer.
But I refuse to be a laughingstock.
If it's war the French want, that is what they will get!
Wait, we don't have to do this.
Perhaps, but everything's pushing us to do so!
Just tell me one thing, monsieur...
Why did you side with Mortimer?
He is alone, isolated. The United States can do nothing to help you and France is surrounded by over ten countries just waiting for the word to pounce.
Really, I don't see why you choose Mortimer.
Because he's going to beat Holm.
Oh it's really quite simple, you know.
Whose place are we at?
Who can manage to bring together so many influential figures under the same roof?
Technically, Sir Gregory brought more guests than Mortimer.
Yes, but in who's name? Who organized the party, seÃ±or Godoy? Who pays the bills?
And you are forgetting something fundamental. Who has the biggest army nowadays?
Uh yes yes...
There's no shame in admitting that France is militarily superior to you.
That's why you are considering joining forces with other European countries in order to confront us.
I agree that Mortimer does have some powerful assets.
Because the Order supports Mortimer.
The Golden Order, my friend.
The Order is everywhere. We come from France, we are present in the United States, England, and many other countries.
We have ambitions and the means to carry them out.
You'll see, once all hell breaks out, and your English support starts to fade away.
The Order is an international organization. It matters little what governments do...
Otherwise why would Mortimer have gone to the trouble of inviting my mother?
mmh? If you are right, Sir Gregory has got it all wrong...
The United States will become the greatest democratic state in the world!
But, monsieur, just think about it...
It will enable the United States to become a giant democratic state.
What a message for the rest of the world!
We will shove your damned democracy down your throat, de Richet!
I will raise the whole of Europe against you!
Tell me, do you really believe Spain has any interest in ceding Louisiana to France?
What would HE gain from doing do?
Duke Manuel, for Spain, I don't know. But for you, I am convinced that Lord Mortimer will thank you generously.
Oh, you would not be trying to bribe me, would you?
Nothing could be further from my mind.
It would be an insult to believe that someone such as yourself, might have a practical attitude towards his virtue.
Even so, it is only natural that you be supported and encouraged, if you were to follow Lord Mortimer.
Isn't it?
Indeed, for services rendered, it would be natural for me to receive compensation for the time spent achieving such an undertaking, yes?
Naturally.
And given your status, my Lord Duke, the compensation would have to be considerable.
Naturally.
Fight against England together
My Lord Duke, you know as well as I do that our common enemy is and will always be England
I don't believe you would look favorably at its embargo on France. Its ships cross the Atlantic ocean right up to your coastline.
Do not even mention it!
If those tea drinkers try anything in these waters, I will send the whole of the Spanish fleet to calm them down.
Spain could get a good price for the territory
I am convinced that Spain could get a very very tidy price for the territory.
Were you sleeping during the conference?
Did you not hear Lord Mortimer ask me to cede it free of charge?
Yes but you...
No, you listen, young man, do us a favor and stop poking your nose into grown-ups' business.
You are wasting my time!
Off the top of my head, I don't see...
I won't lie to you, sir. I don't think I've seen all the advantages.
But surely that's because we haven't truly considered all the consequences.
Can you hear yourself speak?
Reassure me...  the aim of this meeting is not to convince me to follow Mortimer, I hope!
Louisiana poses more problems than it brings rewards
First of all, the question is to know what Louisiana can be used for.
We agree that, today, all it brings you is death.
Everyday, a few more Spaniards die, far from their birthplace...
I cannot deny that Louisiana is a veritable quagmire.
You have a point there.
Tell me one last thing...
What would I gain from all this?
To be free from Holm
You unshackle yourself from Sir Gregory, who, let's face it, takes up a lot of space.
What are you talking about?
My friend, I'm guessing that you wouldn't mind getting a little freedom from the overbearing control he exerts.
I would never have gotten where I am today without him!
He is an influential man, who is true to his word and who has always given me his full attention.
But he obliges you to...
That's enough! I will not allow you to stab him in the back! Sir Gregory is a respectable gentleman and your petty manipulations have no effect on me!
If that's your only argument then you are on the wrong track!
Blackmail him!
Duke Manuel, you have everything to gain...
I cannot see what, actually.
Well, if the Queen found out where your heart really lies, she might well become very unhappy.
What do you mean?...
It's not inconceivable that a letter written by your own hand might have come into my possession...
In which you declare such love to "Pepita" that even I became moved.
You've been in my room...
And I am afraid that if by some misfortune this letter ended up in the hands of the Queen, she also would be... moved...
You thieving...
Come now, my Lord Duke.
We are all gentlemen here. I am convinced it is not going to happen.
Or will it?
That is blackmail...  You bastard!
You have no idea of the consequences!!
Lord Mortimer knows how to look after his friends. Don't you worry about Sir Gregory.
You are protected, have no fear.
Mortimer will be grateful to you
I am sure that Lord Mortimer will be very appreciative. He's always supported those who have given him help.
And you know well that he has every means to do so.
That at least is true.
[Force him to war] Push him to breaking pint.
Now listen up, you pretentious little aristocrat, you haven't got a choice here!
If you don't want me to spread the word of your passionate affair with Pepita, you'd better do as I say...
Is that clear?
I think you have just made a very big mistake, Monsieur de Richet.
You have no idea of the mess you've put yourself in.
Is it war you want?
Alright, you'll soon see!
Speak to him about what he won't lose rather
If you continue with Holm, our two countries will become rivals.
It could turn to war, who knows.
It's likely even.
A war...  Duke Manuel. On our own territories.
Do you really see yourself committing the Kingdom of Spain to an armed conflict against France?
Can you imagine the financial investment required, not to mention the loss of lives and dishonor at the slightest defeat?
Do you see yourself being the man responsible for that?
... No.
But you are the one who's pushing me into it, you damned Frenchman!
I'm not pushing you into anything, Duke Manuel.
If you are a man of the future and of progress, as I'm given to believe, you will know how much suffering a war would bring.
Consolidate your position at the court of Spain.
My Lord Duke, in these uncertain times, I believe it would be to your advantage to be rid of Louisiana, in order to focus your attention on your colonies in the South.
It will show the Court the man you really are and how much you truly deserve your position.
And it will silence all the gibes and jeers aimed at my person.
Then people would only see me as the man who consolidated the frontiers of the Spanish Empire.
What a statesman you are.
GOOD OUTCOME - GODOY SAYS HE WILL VOTE FOR MORTIMER
Come on, you fool, give it up. You're trapped like a rat!
Monsieur, I'm astounded. I did not think you capable but you've succeeded.
I will be more wary of you the next time.
Nonetheless, if you can guarantee Lord Mortimer's support, then, yes, you can count on my vote when the time comes.
However, I expect you to be discreet with regard to my former partners, without which our agreement will become null and void.
Of course, my Lord Duke. You can count on me.
Lord Mortimer will be delighted to hear the news.
I hope you know what you're getting into, Louis.
I bid you good luck.
Good night, my Lord Duke.
See you tomorrow.
BAD OUTCOME  - GODOY SAYS HE WILL NOT VOTE FOR HOLM
How could you ever think a pup like you could manipulate me in this way, for a single second?
Never will I follow you!
Let me tell you that not only do I refuse any collusion with you but I will go much further...
I declare war on you, Monsieur de Richet! On you, on your family! On your country!
I will give you war like you've never seen before!
Now get out of here!
Well, well, I hope Mortimer knows what he's doing, because he's going to get his bloody war.
Manuel, I am very surprised by your response.
Shit, it's worse than before...
My Lord Duke, there must be a misunderstanding. Come now, there's no need for anything like that.
I am convinced that...
GET OUT OF HERE!
Duke Manuel?
Well, well, Monsieur de Richet. I was not expecting you.
I am not in the mood, sir, I warn you.
What do you want from me, sir?
Ask why was he angry when he arrived
I see you are still feeling under pressure.

Well, if the Queen found out where your heart really lies, she might well become very unhappy.
What do you mean?...
It's not inconceivable that a letter written by your own hand might have come into my possession...
In which you declare such love to "Pepita" that even I became moved.
You've been in my room...
And I am afraid that if by some misfortune this letter ended up in the hands of the Queen, she also would be... moved...
You thieving...
Come now, my Lord Duke.
We are all gentlemen here. I am convinced it is not going to happen.
Or will it?
That is blackmail...  You bastard!
You have no idea of the consequences!!
Lord Mortimer knows how to look after his friends. Don't you worry about Sir Gregory.
You are protected, have no fear.
Mortimer will be grateful to you
I am sure that Lord Mortimer will be very appreciative. He's always supported those who have given him help.
And you know well that he has every means to do so.
That at least is true.
[Force him to war] Push him to breaking pint.
Now listen up, you pretentious little aristocrat, you haven't got a choice here!
If you don't want me to spread the word of your passionate affair with Pepita, you'd better do as I say...
Is that clear?
I think you have just made a very big mistake, Monsieur de Richet.
You have no idea of the mess you've put yourself in.
Is it war you want?
Alright, you'll soon see!
Speak to him about what he won't lose rather
If you continue with Holm, our two countries will become rivals.
It could turn to war, who knows.
It's likely even.
A war...  Duke Manuel. On our own territories.
Do you really see yourself committing the Kingdom of Spain to an armed conflict against France?
Can you imagine the financial investment required, not to mention the loss of lives and dishonor at the slightest defeat?
Do you see yourself being the man responsible for that?
... No.
But you are the one who's pushing me into it, you damned Frenchman!
I'm not pushing you into anything, Duke Manuel.
If you are a man of the future and of progress, as I'm given to believe, you will know how much suffering a war would bring.
Consolidate your position at the court of Spain.
My Lord Duke, in these uncertain times, I believe it would be to your advantage to be rid of Louisiana, in order to focus your attention on your colonies in the South.
It will show the Court the man you really are and how much you truly deserve your position.
And it will silence all the gibes and jeers aimed at my person.
Then people would only see me as the man who consolidated the frontiers of the Spanish Empire.
What a statesman you are.
GOOD OUTCOME - GODOY SAYS HE WILL VOTE FOR MORTIMER
Come on, you fool, give it up. You're trapped like a rat!
Monsieur, I'm astounded. I did not think you capable but you've succeeded.
I will be more wary of you the next time.
Nonetheless, if you can guarantee Lord Mortimer's support, then, yes, you can count on my vote when the time comes.
However, I expect you to be discreet with regard to my former partners, without which our agreement will become null and void.
Of course, my Lord Duke. You can count on me.
Lord Mortimer will be delighted to hear the news.
I hope you know what you're getting into, Louis.
I bid you good luck.
Good night, my Lord Duke.
See you tomorrow.
BAD OUTCOME  - GODOY SAYS HE WILL NOT VOTE FOR HOLM
How could you ever think a pup like you could manipulate me in this way, for a single second?
Never will I follow you!
Let me tell you that not only do I refuse any collusion with you but I will go much further...
I declare war on you, Monsieur de Richet! On you, on your family! On your country!
I will give you war like you've never seen before!
Now get out of here!
Well, well, I hope Mortimer knows what he's doing, because he's going to get his bloody war.
Manuel, I am very surprised by your response.
Shit, it's worse than before...
My Lord Duke, there must be a misunderstanding. Come now, there's no need for anything like that.
I am convinced that...
GET OUT OF HERE!
Marie Louise of Parma.
How ironic having a painting of the Queen of Spain in one's room, my Lord Duke.
Notice something.
Mmmm...  It looks like someone's hidden something on the back of this painting.
It's a letter.
Of course, it's written in Spanish. And it reeks of lavender.
Well, well. Monsieur Godoy, you seem very interested in hiding this letter. Another secret romance I presume ?
Observe the painting.
Ah, looks like someone's slipped something in the back here.
It's a letter. Let's see what it says.
It reeks of perfume and it's written in Spanish.
Godoy, you really are a little devil... 
Translate the letter
So, let's see what it says.
Leave

I feel awful at having to leave you after a silly little spat, because you are the only woman I love, Josepha, forever... 
I told you before: everything I have, everything I can offer you, I owe to the affection of the Queen.
Let's stay united, please, even in sacrifice, for the two of us, for our future children!
Stop being jealous: you are the only one who fills my thoughts, everything else is just a game, I swear... "

It seems the Queen isn't the only one enjoying the Lord Duke's favors... 
If the Queen found out, it would cost him dearly.
I'll keep it with me, you never know.

Good evening, Monsieur le franÃ§ais...
Duchess...
You here, what a charming surprise...
I'm beginning to think you can't be without me.
You have managed to penetrate my armor, sir.
Am I disturbing you, perhaps?
Not at all, Emily
That's not what I said.
Go to bed, Louis, this is not the right time
Emily, if you don't mind, I've had an exhausting day. I can hardly stand.
Are you sending me away?
No! No, not at all, but I was thinking of going to bed to be honest.
Would there perhaps be a little space for me in your large and cold bed?
Invite her to say
Of course, Emily.
I can always make room for you.
Ah, by the way, congratulations on choosing Sir Gregory this evening.
You surprised me, I wasn't expecting it.
Why Emily, can't you read me like an open book?
Not as well as you read me, it would seem.
I'll teach you, if you'd like...
There's nothing I'd like more...
Ah, by the way, you surprised me during the conference.
Why is that?
Well... you are going to lose.
Why stay with Lord Mortimer?
I believe he has every chance of winning.
My, you are a rash one.
However, if ever you want to change sides, please feel free to let me know.
But tell me... you didn't come here to try and make me change my mind, did you?
That's the last thing on my mind, although you would have everything to gain by it.
I prefer Mortimer
There's no point trying to persuade me...
Don't hold it against me.
Of course not, silly.
Why would I change sides?
Do you perhaps know something that I don't?
Come on Emily, it's time you lay your cards on the table...
She knows something about Louisiana
If you have a good reason for Spain to keep Louisiana, I'm all ears...
Louis, I can assure you on good authority that the crown will never let France take over Louisiana without taking firm action.
Your country has everything to lose... especially now, it being weakened as it is on the home front.
In other words, you believe the aim is to weaken France...
Just an observation, Louis.
She knows something about Mortimer
If you know something I don't about Lord Mortimer, now's the time...
I don't want to speak ill of him but in certain circles, you can't exactly say he has a good reputation.
Continue...
Well, there have been instances where he has used people, then gotten rid of them once he no longer seemed to need them, Louis.
He makes fine promises, makes you feel valuable, tests you...
But beware. I'm worried that something might happen to you.
Are you advising me to change sides as a precaution?
I'd rather say: as a safety measure.
Louis, if you trust me, you ought to ask yourself why I have chosen Holm.
You do trust me, don't you?
Yes
Of course, Emily.
No
It's got nothing to do with trust.
Oh... Oh.
So, you don't trust me then.
I love the way you don't really reply, in order to avoid getting involved.
No, but make her believe so
Of course, Emily. You know you have my full trust.
Louis, you're lying, that's not good.
Anymore of that and I might get upset.
Admit, though, that it does make you think.
There's still time, you know.
Join us before it's too late.
Change sides
I admit... you've sown the seed of doubt.
But I don't know how Lord Mortimer is gonna take my last-minute change of mind....
Don't worry yourself about that, really! It's only discussions and verbal jousting...
No one's going to die, whatever happens... And Sir Gregory will be there to support you.
Very well! You can count on me to join your side, then.
But don't tell anyone until the vote...
Promise.
We'll make a good team, you'll see.
Stay for Mortimer.
Unfortunately, my word is my bond.
I don't want to leave Lord Mortimer in the lurch.
Very well, as you wish.
It's up to you to decide.
Tell me, are these visits to Mortimer's always so intense?
Yes and no...
My sister doesn't normally disappear like she has.
Any news of your mother?
Speak about Emma
Well, I should imagine you're still shaken...
I promise to shed light on my mother's circumstances as soon as possible.
There's not much to shed light on! What your mother did is inexcusable!
She won the trust of my sister in order to more easily betray her.
She didn't do anything to her! I...
Speak to her about Emma
Still nothing.
And you, any news of your sister?
No... but knowing her, I'm persuaded she's on someone's trail.
You'll see, she'll surprise us all!
If only you knew, Emily...
You're right! We must remain positive. I'm sure it won't be long before she turns up.
My thoughts, too.
She is Duchess Hillsborrow, after all!
And as such, she is capable of anything.
I am sure that you'll appreciate her, you'll see.
No doubt about that.
And it might turn out that you prefer her to me. Who knows?
Maybe so
Indeed, who knows!
You like to play with fire, Louis.
Not really
Rest assured, I don't think it's going to happen.
I'm sure she's very nice but there is only one Emily Hillsborrow.
We shall see...
Tell her Sarah's been seen
I've seen her, Emily.
What?? When was that?
A little earlier, just before the conference.
She was hiding.
And did you manage to speak to her?
She's not the same. I don't know what's been happening to her but she's changed.
I found her in a deplorable state, with... with one of her hands cut off. She was saying crazy things, bordering on delirium.
What?? Did you say one of her hands was cut off?
What happened to her?
I don't know, she... she wouldn't say.
And did she tell you why she...
...why...
Why she shot Emma?
No, unfortunately we were unable to broach the subject.
She seemed terribly upset, Emily. There's something strange going on here.
She was fearful of something or someone.
Excuse me, Louis, but until we see proof of the contrary, she's the one who is sowing death everywhere she goes.
We are the ones who ought to be fearful.
I know... I know.
No, I apologize for that remark.
Who do you think she's hiding from? Mortimer?
I don't know. Maybe.
Louis, I don't want to pile it on, but I would understand her feelings there. You ought to be wary of Mortimer!
He's a manipulator, a liar, a coward who doesn't assume his responsibilities at all!
What exactly happened between you two, Emily?
You're so radically against him.
But how do you know she shot Emma? I didn't tell you.
You knew it...
...and you never said anything.
Well, Louis, keeping your little secrets to yourself?
That's not nice.
I was afraid for you...
No need to justify yourself, you know, we both have our secrets.
No
Still nothing, no.
Very well...
Lie to her
I haven't had a minute to myself what with the disappearance of Elizabeth and then the conference...
Yes, I hope to continue my investigation tomorrow.
Do you have any leads?
No, not really. That's the problem.
Too bad...
Can we change subject, please?
I didn't come here to talk about that again.
Of course, it's late, you're right.
Come, Louis.
Send her away
Now, don't take this the wrong way, Emily, but I have to turn this proposition down, as tempting as it is.
It's late, it's going to be a big day tomorrow.
We'd better get some rest in our rooms.
Very well, I understand...
Good night, Emily... sleep tight.
Thank you... same to you.

Good night, Emily... sleep tight.
Thank you... same to you.
How can he be so blind?
If he keeps this up, he'll lead our countries to their destruction!
Don't worry, we shall counter him, Sir Gregory.
We have to act immediately!
Calm down, Gregory, we only have to vote against his project and that's it.
They haven't got a chance, just one vote will suffice.
True... There is no chance of a unanimous vote.
He must be preparing something else... What is he plotting?
Reveal Mortimer's plan
I know about his plan.
What did you just say, Louis?
His aim is for the United States to take the whole of the North American continent.
But that is impossible!
A democratic super power...
I don't understand. That has nothing to do with the coming vote.
He will ask for France to take over Louisiana and then hand it over to the United States, and so double the size of their territory.
Once that's done, he will just need to push a bit more and you will lose North America, Duke Manuel.
God's blood, has he gone mad?
No, Johann, he has always been mad...
...
Louis, I would like to thank you for what you've just revealed.
If not for you, I don't know if we'd have been capable of deciphering his plans quickly enough to be able to counter him.
What are we going to do now that we know about it?
Destroy him!
No! We'll beat him at his own game, my friends.
Say nothing
We shall shortly find out so let's take the lead!
What do you mean by that?
His plan begins with Louisiana, which is still yours, Duke Manuel. He will begin with you.
Expect to receive an envoy, French most probably.
He will try to convince you by every possible means.
Whatever he says, whatever he promises, you have just one response:
It's war!
If war is what you want, war is what you get! And on your own territory! In your homes!
Enough games. Spain will join the coalition against France and declare war.
You too, Duchess Hillsborrow. You will speak to the Queen so that Great Britain commits to going to war with France!
What do you expect from the Papal States, Sir Gregory?
What do you think? That they hold a mass?!
They will go to war, of course! What is it that you didn't understand in what I just told you?
We all declare war on France! Militarily, politically, and financially!
And me?...
How can I help?
Louis, you have won my trust.
The Order will have to act in France, but even before that I'm going to need you.
Right here, and right now.
Say nothing
...
Leave me now. I have to prepare for tomorrow.
Let's meet early tomorrow morning for the next phase of the conference which promises to be most exciting.
Er, Louis! I'd like to see you a moment, please.
Thank you for siding with me today. I won't forget it.
I'm going to need you. Help me counter Mortimer on his own ground, right here.
I'm sure he'll try and win some of you over. He needs our votes.
You leave that to me.
In the meantime, I must ask you to go and see President Washington and persuade him to trust me and join us.
Am I really the right person for this?
Do you really think that I'll be able to convince him?
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
But I have total faith in you. He likes you and thus he won't see you coming.
You must be careful, though. If he senses that you are trying to manipulate him, he'll dig in his heels.
Louis, use every means at your disposal. If Washington drops Mortimer, his defeat will be complete.
Will do
I'll do my best.
You should go right away. There's no time to lose. William already has a head start on us.
Very well, I'll go right away.
E...
Emily?
Emily? Are you there?
Typical...  there she goes again!
What's with this habit of hers of taking off in the middle of the night...
Sir, the conference is about to begin.
You are expected in the conference room.
Tell them I'm coming. Thank you.
Come on, Louis, the game is back on...
E...
Emily?
Emily? Are you there?

WÃ¶llner is probably still behind the door. Best go out through the balcony, just in case.

So Bonaparte is going to publish a book that he didn't write...  that crafty little rascal... 
My friends, I would like to thank you for staying.
Good god, William, what is this I hear about you reinforcing military power in Louisiana?!
I have no interest in having France for a neighbor and you know that very well!
Calm down, George.
Louis... explain our plan to Mr Washington, please.
I'm not sure I rightly understand
I would have been only too glad to, Lord Mortimer.
Unfortunately, I'm not sure myself that I have fully understood all the details of your plan.
Oh Louis...
The United States is going to expand
You see, Mr President, Lord Mortimer anticipates that once France obtains Louisiana, they will cede it to you.
What do you mean? To us? The United States?
You heard right.
But... I...
President Washington, the United States will double in size!
By what miracle have you...
You need to expand, George. You and France are the two major democracies in the modern world.
It is necessary that you both become super powers!
Are you really gonna sponsor democracy throughout the world?
Of course, Monsieur PÃ©ru.
That's why I don't want Spain to get too attached to those wetlands.
Please, continue, Louis. Explain my vision to Mr President.
Of course.
By going through France, Spain won't suspect that it's you who is going to take possession of Louisiana.
They'll even believe that France will be a protective buffer between itself in California, and you on the East coast.
If SeÃ±or Godoy was afraid that you might take the territory by force, now he is reassured.
You would never attack France.
Of course
Mr President, Lord Mortimer intends for you to conquer all the North American continent.
He's relying on you to not stop at Louisiana but to continue to push west.
Indeed, it would be dishonest to pretend that this is not my final objective.
Frankly, I didn't grasp everything
Between you and me, Lord Mortimer, I'd rather let you explain.
That's why you need to expand, George.
And I don't just mean Louisiana.
That's just the first step. You will soon take over the whole of the northern continent.
You will become a nation able to compete with any of the super powers of Europe or elsewhere.
But why didn't you tell me before?
For more spontaneity
So that Lord Mortimer would appear to be isolated, without support.
Exactly, you got it, Louis.
Lord Mortimer retains the advantage by advancing under cover. And for it to work he needed you to act surprised...
To keep one step ahead
So Holm doesn't see it coming.
But by the time it dawns on SeÃ±or Godoy, it'll be too late because he will realize that he's just lost all the North American continent.
We all know that you won't stop once the path is cleared before you.
What do you mean?
You see, Monsieur PÃ©ru, it's very likely that, once Louisiana becomes American, President Washington will push out even more and take the west coast.
Say nothing
...
George, I was banking on your surprise.
The more Gregory thinks I'm weakened the broader my scope of action will be.
William, you haven't changed. Always one step ahead.
One step ahead? You're joking, more like five!
On that note, my friends, it's getting late.
Mr President, continue to take offense over my project when we resume the conference in the morning. You do it to a tee.
And if Sir Gregory has the audacity to send you an emissary to convince you to go against me, do me a favor, string him along, if you can.
The more they believe we are divided, the more we'll have our hands free.
Only too happy to oblige.
Now, let us get some rest, we've got a big day tomorrow.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night.
Louis, if you have a minute.
I would like to ask a favor of you. I'm going to require your services.
How can I be of help? Tell me all about it.
Our adversaries are many and the closing vote of the conference will soon be upon us. Time is of an essence so I'll need you to assist me this evening.
How can I help?
I need you to go, this very evening, to persuade SeÃ±or Godoy to join us. He is the backbone of Gregory's resistance.
Turn him round and all the others will follow in such a stampede that Gregory will be able to do nothing but admit defeat.
Lord Mortimer, with all due respect, don't you think I'm the last person Godoy wants to talk to?
I'm sure you can do it. I believe in you.
He's hiding something from me!
Lord Mortimer, you're not telling me everything.
Let's say I wouldn't disapprove if the right honorable though nonetheless choleric Duke Manuel put you in his bad books.
If it could motivate him to declare war on France, it would greatly serve our interests.
War? What do you mean?
I told you before the conference.
The more we distract Spain from the Americas, the less it will have an eye on Louisiana.
But all the same, we're talking about a war in Europe.
Don't worry. That's why Mr Bonaparte is with us.
I am convinced we'll be perfectly capably of managing the conflict.
And SeÃ±or Godoy is not a great soldier. He will not commit Spain to a long war that he won't be capable of managing.
Alright, we shall see
If you believe that's the best way, then...
Nevertheless, I wouldn't bring up all the habits and customs of the court with him too much.
I sense he's on edge at the moment, I doubt he'll be able to abide by the rules of etiquette that befit his rank.
Thanks for the advice.
However, it must be done for the conference tomorrow morning. It's important, Louis.
I'll go straight away.
Thank you, my boy.
And get some rest afterwards. Big day tomorrow.
Aren't you afraid our projects for Italy may be discovered before we...
Oh, please excuse us, Louis, but I need to speak with Lord Mortimer in private.
No, no. What do you want, Louis?
Some advice when approaching Godoy
I'm going to have a word with Duke Manuel but...  You know him better than I do, I believe...
Yes, avoid any marks of respect and protocol pertaining to his rank.
He is not fond of courtly manners.
Thank you for the advice, my Lord.
How is the rest of the conference going to play out
When are we supposed to vote?
The conference resumes tomorrow morning...
That leaves little time for the...  little favor I spoke to you about.
Indeed, I'll go straight away.
Leave them to talk
I shall be leaving you.

It hasn't been signed yet but there's a letter with it...
Read the letter
Examine the writing
It isn't signed. That's some quality paper...  And that handwriting...
I'd say it's Mortimer's.
Put back the letter on the manuscript

As promised here are the few pages that I recommend you publish within the next few months.

Well, that's one thing out of the way!
Only thing left to do is wait for the conference to resume tomorrow morning.
Shit, what a failure!
There is nothing more I can do except wait for the conference to resume tomorrow morning.
Well, that's one thing out of the way!

Shit, that was a failure!

Well, that's one thing out of the way!
Only thing left to do is wait for the conference to resume tomorrow morning.
Shit, that was a failure!
There's nothing more I can do except wait for the conference to resume tomorrow morning.
Leave me alone.
I asked you to leave me alone.
Wait!
De Richet...
You just can't help it, can you! Stop trying to play the hero, man!
He doesn't deserve that
Monsieur, I know I don't really know you, but you seem like a decent person.
I have done so many horrible things...
You blame yourself. I can see that. Everything's not lost.
I don't want to do bad things anymore...
You can take control of yourself again. You can fix whatever it is you've done.
Do you really believe that?
Of course, Jacques. You'll have all the time you need.
Make him think of his child!
Jacques, don't do it.
You're a father, you owe it to...
You bastard!
I'm going to help him
Jacques, you know you can count on me.
Calm down, please, I'm going to help you.
There's nothing you can do for me.
It's not like him
Jacques, calm down, you... you're frightening everyone.
Look at yourself, this is not the real you, come on.
Rest assured, my friends. You're in no danger from me.
He's not going to kill anyone
Jacques, everyone's getting a little heated, so let's take it easy a moment.
You're not going to kill anyone. You're going to calmly put away your...
It's going to be alright
I'm sure we can work things out.
But you don't know him...
Let's stay united, Jacques.
He's nothing without us.
Really?...
Trust me.
Holm can protect him
I've got an idea. If you are so afraid of Lord Mortimer's reaction, what if you joined sides with Sir Gregory?
Wake up, Louis... Holm or Mortimer, it's the same thing...
The Order can protect him
I'm sure we can find a solution.
The Golden Order can look after you, for example.
My boy, you just don't understand...
Your daughter has nothing to fear
Look, you've done as much as you can!
You have nothing to fear, your daughter is safe.
Shut up!
Let's stand together
Jacques, you're not alone!
There's nothing you can do against him...
Of course there is. We've already started!
How can you say that, knowing he's already probably gotten rid of your mother, Louis?
No he hasn't. She's still here, she's alive, Jacques.
But...
Yes, trust me.
Appease him
Come on, Jacques. Stop now, before it gets any worse.
Give me the gun, please.
I wasn't gonna fire at anyone, you know...
I know.
Be firm!
Jacques, don't shoot.
Give me the gun, come on.
Sorry, Louis.
Take it from him!
Calm down now, Jacques.
It's over!
You have no idea what you just put me through.
It would be nice if we could all settle down a bit.
And let us thank Louis for his intervention.  That was very courageous of him.
All this agitation isn't worthy of us
This is not who you are. You're better than that.
You don't know me!
Yes, I do. I know you're no coward.
So give me your weapon, please.
But... I...
There's nothing to fear. I'm right here.
I don't want him to talk to me...
Don't worry, you're safe now, Jacques...
Monsieur PÃ©ru, you could have seriously hurt someone, if Monsieur de Richet here hadn't stopped you.
Your behavior is unacceptable.
You would do better to go and rest in your apartment.
My friends, we shall continue the conference later.
I would like to apologize for the inexcusable behavior of my guest.
We all need to recover from all of this... excitement. Take the rest of the day off.
"My dear little ElÃ©onore,
I wanted to share with you my calmer thoughts of the moment... 
Needless to say how much I miss you and how much I regret having to be separated from you.
But I know you will be virtuous, courageous and safe with your sister, Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne.
I will never be able to mend my mistakes but I do know now how to save you form their consequences once and for all.
Be always assured of my fatherly devotion and affection, never doubt it, come what may.
You must know that everything will turn out for the best now.
I am determined to protect you whatever the price I have to pay, and so be confident and serene in times of ordeal.
With all my love,
Your ever-proud father."

Leave me, de Richet...  I don't feel like talking.
Question him on the state of his room.
Your door was ajar, and given the state of your room I...
I was worried.
It's none of your business.
Stay and keep quiet
Are you gonna keep sticking to me like glue?
...
Hell's bells, I don't deserve this...
Leave.
There's nothing you can do for me.
What's going on?
Maybe I can help?
Not anymore, you can't. Not against him.
But thanks for the offer.
Who are you talking about?
You know very well...
Lord Mortimer?
You talk as if you were in danger, monsieur.
Has he threatened you in any way?
I'm done for, Monsieur de Richet.
I played with the devil and I lost.
He is stronger than that!
Come on, pull yourself together, for goodness sake.
You're a man of character, headstrong even. It's not like you to give in.
You don't understand.
Leave me now.
Make him talk, Louis!
Don't you think it would be good for you to shed your burden?
That is my intention...
You're worried.
You have a secret.
You're afraid of talking about it.
Afraid for me if he spoke to me?
You're afraid of what might happen to me if you told me about it?
Absolutely not.
You're not the center of the world, you know.
Afraid for himself?
So you are afraid of what might happen to YOU, if you talked to me about it.
No.
My fate is already sealed.
Afraid for others
You're protecting someone...
Who is dear to you.
And apparently, you're prepared to die for that person.
Twice over...
He is not alone, he has his daughter
Are you afraid for your daughter?
What do you...
Be careful de Richet. Be very careful what you're about to say if you don't want to go flying off the balcony!
What do you know about her?
Nothing, apart from the fact that you love her and you're saying goodbye to her.
I read your letter on your desk...
I...
I ought to get rid of you!
Perhaps I can I help you?
The hero syndrome.
You always think you can fix things.
She will be safer faraway from me! That's it!
What's more, no one must find out where or who she is!
Is that clear?
Perfectly.
But why say goodbye to her? She must still need you.
The only thing she needs is for him never to find her.
The devil?
What did he do for you to describe him in this way?
I described him exactly as he is. What else do I call him?
He lures you in, makes you feel important, pushes you forward.
He charms you day after day, reads you with such ease. He understands your weaknesses, overcomes your resistance.
He talks to you again and again, until you can no longer say no.
Come sir, how can a man like you...
Why doesn't he leave?
If you fear the worst, why not leave?
What difference would that make?
No, the solution is here, whether I like it or not...
I don't understand...
I don't give a toss if you understand or not, de Richet!
Now leave me in peace!
Time is short, Louis.
Follow my advice. Find your mother if she's still alive, and get out of here!
Flee this damned island of doom.
Are we in danger?
You've been in danger since the minute you set foot on this rock.
He wants you, he's sizing you up. He is circling around you.
It's blindingly obvious.
And you, flattered as you are, will soon be running around for him, just to keep your place among his precious few. It feels so good to be accepted by him.
You will experience power, wealth, glory...  he will give it all to you.
Until one day, you'll feel so eaten up inside that you will no longer know who you are.
You will find yourself void of all conscience, of all freedom.
And can no longer look at yourself in the mirror without feeling sick.
Refuse, I tell you! From now on say no. NO!
Look, I'm sorry about what happened on the night you arrived.
You're a good man, Louis. You look after yourself.
As for me, I shall take back my freedom tomorrow morning.
I'm through with it all.
There you go! Back in the saddle! I'm glad to hear it!
Come on, it's late, I'd like to get some rest.
Very well, I'll leave you then. See you tomorrow, monsieur.
Monsieur de Richet, you are expected at the conference... 
Please take the door to your left to join the guests... 
Monsieur de Richet, you're the only one missing at the conference... 
Please join the guests.
What can I do for you, sir?
I am at your service, day and night, sir.
Do you know where Monsieur Washington is?
Would you happen to know where I can find Monsieur Washington?
Sorry, sir, I haven't the foggiest. Perhaps sir ought to try in President Washington's room?
Do you know where Godoy is?
Have you seen Duke Manuel?
The Duke is in the dining room, sir.
Take your leave
Let me in, please.
Er, I...  I'm sorry, sir, but that's impossible.
What's going on in there?
Come now, there's nothing secret going on in there...  Let me in.
Oh, I'm sorry but I cannot say, sir, I am to follow Lord Mortimer's instructions.
Who is still inside?
Can you at least tell me who is still in the room? I'm looking for a guest.
Of course, sir. It would seem that only Lord Mortimer and Mr Napoleon are present.
The other guests have gone back to their rooms by another door.
Do you know where Washington is?
I'm looking for President Washington. Would you know where he is by any chance?
Er, unfortunately not, sir. All I can say to sir is that the president is no longer in the conference room.
Alright, I'll go looking for him myself... 
End the conversation
Thank you... 
Have a good evening, sir.
I would like to come in...
I am sorry, sir, but that is not possible for the moment.
What's going on in there?
Why?
Sir Gregory's orders, sir.
Who is inside?
I'm looking for someone...  tell me at least who's in there so that I don't needlessly go looking around for hours.
Duchess Hillsborrow is speaking with Sir Gregory, sir.
The other guests have gone back to their rooms through the other side.
I'm looking for Duke Manuel.
Can you tell me where I can find Duke Manuel, please?
Alas, I do not know, sir. I can only assure you he is not is the small salon.
End the conversation
Very well...  Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
My friends, do not worry. I assure you that Lord Mortimer's plan will never see the light of day.
I shall deal with informing our allies but for the time being, I need you to make a stand.
What do you think about Monsieur de Richet?
I don't know yet...  I feel there's great potential in him.
He looks like he can be trusted.
Certainly not! He's a prig, a show-off! A Frenchman, in other words!
Why isn't he with us? He was opposed to Mortimer.
I'll wait and see. I'm still not sure of his position.
And Duchess Hillsborrow?
Why isn't she here?
She's busy. Don't worry about her.
Oh, isn't it time to replace her?
Not so fast, sir. She is an important figure.
You ought to have a little more faith in her.
What are we going to do about Washington?
He will be a hard nut to crack.
On our chessboard, he is Mortimer's King.
Don't worry, Mr President only wants one thing, to keep his dear America united.
He won't jeopardize everything he has achieved on a whim.
He has been serving Mortimer for quite some time. It won't be easy to...  bring him around.
I have asked Monsieur de Richet to approach him.
Let us have faith in him.
I sense that Mr PÃ©ru is about to surprise us too.
Yet, he is Mortimer's strong arm in France.
He knows his time has come and I believe he is intelligent enough to realize it means he is no longer any use to Mortimer.
Do you feel alright, Mr Godoy?
You haven't said a word.
Please excuse me, gentlemen. I feel...  tired.
Oh...  I see.
I think it is high time you left us then.
Now!
Locked...
To pick the lock
Force open
Shit! I've broken it!
Oh well, never mind, let's see what Washington has to hide, shall we?
Use the small key
The President's personal reserve of laudanum.
And judging by the quantity, he can't go without it.
Ah, there's also a letter.
Move away

Louis? Why... what are you doing in my room?
Pretend you heard a burglar
As I walked by your room I noticed the door was open.
I wanted to check no one had gone in.
And? What is the outcome of your investigation, inspector de Richet?
Go ahead, laugh it off.
I didn't see anyone, Mr President.
Splendid, all is safe and sound.
Tell him you got the wrong room
You're going to laugh, but I got the wrong room.
Are you serious, Louis?
I thought you were a better liar than that. If you don't get better soon, you'll get eaten alive.
Flatter him
I wanted to have a word with you. But just between ourselves.
Here the walls have ears.
You are right, caution is the mother of safety.
Be direct!
Mr President, I won't beat around the bush.
I came to persuade you not to follow Lord Mortimer on this one.
I appreciate your forthrightness, Louis.
That will save us some time.
Well... since you are here... Can I get you something to drink?
No thank you, Mr President.
As you wish...
Well, Louis, it's getting late and this is not my first conference so let's get straight to the point.
You are here to motivate me to change sides.
I hope you are not angry at me.
I know that you...
Louis, we are not children.
You have your reasons. You will understand that your word no longer holds any value for me, but these things do happen.
I only hope you know what you are doing.
This is your first conference and not following the master of ceremony who backed you seems somewhat perilous, but you are young, after all.
I've decided not to follow Mortimer.
I noticed.
Every man must make his own choice, what can we say? That's the political game.
And you did not commit to supporting Mortimer, so there's nothing for you to feel bad about.
So? What can I do for you?
Mortimer's plans go against him
Mr President, I don't believe it is necessary for me to motivate you at all. It's simply in your best interest.
I was there at the conference, remember?
To put it bluntly, Mortimer announced a project that offers absolutely no interest for you.
You said so yourself.
My young friend, I must admit that Lord Mortimer did somewhat surprise me earlier.
You are a laughingstock
Mr President, Mortimer is simply leaving you by the wayside.
Look how smug he was when he addressed you during the conference.
The country closest to his heart is and always will be France. For him the United States is merely a stooge nation in the service of the French.
Louis, your youth might excuse your impetuosity, but not your stupidity.
Without Mortimer, the United Sates wouldn't have made it this far and against all the odds, we are now a nation which everyone wants to rally around.
Whether you understand it or not, it is set to strive ahead.
Speak about Mortimer's plan
President Washington, I regret that my situation is contrary to yours, especially as I really do respect you.
Me too, Louis.
Let us not mix business and emotion.
Understood.
I've just come from a meeting with Sir Gregory and his supporters. They are all rallying against Mortimer's project.
That is to be expected.
Great Britain, the Kingdom of Spain and Sicily, the Kingdom of Prussia , the Holy Empire, the Kingdom of Portugal, of Bohemia and of Hungary.
I know, Louis. I know...
The coalition against France also gives me cause for concern.
I'm certainly not saying that, on paper, Mortimer's plan seems very viable.
Lie
Mr President, Lord Mortimer treats you purely and simply like the least of his pawns. He gives you no explanation and then commits you to a project from which you have nothing to gain.
But you know that more than I do.
Is that what siding with Mortimer is all about?
I must confess that I don't entirely understand William lately.
Your side is going to lose
Look at a map of the world, Mr President.
You have no chance. Your only ally in Mortimer's plan is France and look at the noose tightening around it. All of Europe is rising against it right now.
France has no chance.
That's where you're wrong, Louis.
I expect no direct support from France. That is not their role.
What do you mean?
You ought to have come with us, Louis, I would have been pleased to explain everything to you.
But... I...
I know, it's beyond you.
I do not expect any direct support from France. It is not their role.
Anyway, you haven't really said what you wanted to say.
Tell me, Louis, what have you come here to sell me?
You should join Holm!
And why would I do that?
Let's shake his faith in Mortimer
This type of meeting might be familiar to you but for me, I must admit, Mr President, it's all a bit over my head.
It's only natural, Louis.
But you are managing rather well for a first-timer.
You've chosen the wrong allies, that's all.
I hope my mother doesn't hold it against me if I've made a mistake.
Anyway, if Lord Mortimer does succeed, it would be no mean feat.
Did he tell you what he would gain from it?
What do you mean?
Well, Mortimer's plan has been meticulously prepared for many years, I imagine.
Of that you can be sure.
It's only natural.
And his plan leaves nothing to chance.
No... that's what...
He never commits his own fortune. Let alone his reputation, since you're the one who takes center stage here.
In fact...
Whether he wins or loses, everything is arranged so that he comes out of it intact.
Yes... I...
Ah, you've got to hand it to him, though, he's a master at putting together a plan which puts himself at no risk.
That's true.
Don't worry... he... you can trust him.
Of course.
I'll bet he has invested in a river transport company on the Mississippi, or somewhere like that.
It's true, I had never thought about what he might have to gain.
Out of duty to my mother
You owe it to my mother.
She helped you in your early days, she supported you when you needed it.
I am certain she'd be against this plan.
Do you know who introduced me to Sarah all those years ago?
Lord Mortimer!
Do you know who advised Sarah to start up a chapter of the Golden Order with me in the United States?
Lord Mortimer?
You see my point, then?
I have a lot of respect for your mother, Louis, but my allegiance is to Lord Mortimer.
Blackmail him over the laudanum!
I regret to have to resort to such extreme measures but if you really care about your career, Mr President, I must ask you to follow me.
I beg your pardon, Louis?
Do I detect a threat in your voice, my boy?
You are addicted to Laudanum. We both know that this is a powerful opiate that you take on a daily basis to excess.
If you don't want it to be disclosed publicly, I entreat you to change sides, Mr President.
Louis, I was wrong about you, you learn even quicker than I thought.
Unfortunately, the fact that you are here trying to blackmail me, only makes me cringe even more.
You are now walking a dangerous path, young man.
I would never give in to this sort of tactic.
Do you have any persuasive arguments?
You owe me one!
Well, when you came looking to me for help, I gave it to you.
Now I'm the one asking you for help.
I need you, Mr President.
Louis, I understand what you mean but, even so, the favour you did is not comparable to what you are now asking me to do.
I only asked you to look after a young lady for ten minutes or so.
You're asking me to commit the future of my country.
I know, but I'm not asking without reason, nor to a man without honor !
You are blunt Louis, But I do acknowledge that I owe you a favor.
Because you are already allied to Emily against France.
Yet, hearing you speak, anyone would think that your closest ally is France.
Louis, I don't know...
Of course, you intend to restore and foster an exchange with England.
We both know what that means. It would weaken France's impact on American soil.
From there to relinquishing your agreements with France, is just one simple step.
You've scored a point, Louis.
Go on, I'm listening.
Tell me what Sir Gregory has to offer that I don't already have with Lord Mortimer.
Keep what you already have.
The question is less about what you would gain, Mr President, and more about what you would keep.
After this, you could be in danger of losing everything. Your political career for example.
Don't risk it all on such a wild wager.
Louis, this type of argument is just not going to motivate me to change sides.
I've spent my whole life taking action when everyone was telling me to remain conservative. My choices will not be governed by fear.
You would be able to win colonies
What would you say to winning a few colonies?
I am sure that Sir Gregory would be prepared to discuss the acquisition of new territories.
No thanks, Louis, I'm not interested.
Colonies bring with them their own thorny problems and thus I prefer to focus on the consolidation of American territory.
A small fortune
Don't worry about that, Mr President.
Needless to say, Sir Gregory will be very generous.
I beg your pardon, Louis?
Are you talking about money?...
Do you really believe that money could possibly motivate me to follow you? Is that the image you have of me?
Don't take it the wrong way. You must...
Please be so gracious as to not tell me how I should receive your clumsy bribe, Louis.
No, money does not motivate me at all.
If that is all you have to offer, then I believe we are finished here.
It is in the best interest of the American people
You are a man of conviction, Mr President.  You would never make a choice that could cost the American people very dearly.
If Mortimer falls, he will bring the United States down with him.
Haven't the American people suffered enough?
I would never do anything that would put my people in danger.
Exactly. Therefore, choose your allies wisely, sir.
I must admit your arguments do make sense, Louis.
Promise him Louisiana too
Mr President, it seems Lord Mortimer would rather see Louisiana become French and not American.
Sir Gregory proposes that Louisiana go to you.
What? You would be prepared to hand it over to me?
It is certainly a possibility.
But for that you must not side with Mortimer at the conference.
I see.
Peace.
By following Sir Gregory, you'll be sure to be on the right side of the bayonets, Mr President.
Sir Gregory is encouraging all his partisans to go to war against Lord Mortimer's supporters.
Do you really want to go to war again?
Certainly not.
I would not allow it.
GOOD OUTCOME - WASH SAYS HE WILL VOTE FOR HOLM
Louis, you've convinced me. I congratulate you for your performance because I didn't think it could happen.
I merely exposed the facts to you.
Don't spoil everything with your false modesty, now. You really were very good, and that's that.
In any case, I shall follow you on this one.
This may well arouse Lord Mortimer's wrath, but I must put the United States before anything else.
Have we finished, Louis?
Absolutely, Mr President.
I shan't keep you any longer.
Allow me to take my leave.
Good night, Louis. Get some rest,  tomorrow will be a very big day.
BAD OUTCOME  - WASH SAYS HE WILL VOTE FOR MORTIMER
Listen, Louis, if I had any doubts about Lord Mortimer's project, I stand reassured now.
I hope Sir Gregory has more tricks up his sleeve than you do.  Because I regret to inform you that, as far as politics is concerned, you've got a lot to learn.
But you are still young, so don't worry.
On that note, I would like to get some sleep. Please leave me now.
Good night, Mr President.
Louis? Why... what are you doing in my room?
Pretend you heard a burglar
As I walked by your room I noticed the door was open.
I wanted to check no one had gone in.
And? What is the outcome of your investigation, inspector de Richet?
Go ahead, laugh it off.
I didn't see anyone, Mr President.
Splendid, all is safe and sound.
Tell him you got the wrong room
You're going to laugh, but I got the wrong room.
Are you serious, Louis?
I thought you were a better liar than that. If you don't get better soon, you'll get eaten alive.
Flatter him
I wanted to have a word with you. But just between ourselves.
Here the walls have ears.
You are right, caution is the mother of safety.
Be direct!
Mr President, I won't beat around the bush.
I came to persuade you not to follow Lord Mortimer on this one.
I appreciate your forthrightness, Louis.
That will save us some time.
Well... since you are here... Can I get you something to drink?
No thank you, Mr President.
As you wish...
Well, Louis, it's getting late and this is not my first conference so let's get straight to the point.
You are here to motivate me to change sides.
I hope you are not angry at me.
I know that you...
Louis, we are not children.
You have your reasons. You will understand that your word no longer holds any value for me, but these things do happen.
I only hope you know what you are doing.
This is your first conference and not following the master of ceremony who backed you seems somewhat perilous, but you are young, after all.
I've decided not to follow Mortimer.
I noticed.
Every man must make his own choice, what can we say? That's the political game.
And you did not commit to supporting Mortimer, so there's nothing for you to feel bad about.
So? What can I do for you?
Mortimer's plans go against him
Mr President, I don't believe it is necessary for me to motivate you at all. It's simply in your best interest.
I was there at the conference, remember?
To put it bluntly, Mortimer announced a project that offers absolutely no interest for you.
You said so yourself.
My young friend, I must admit that Lord Mortimer did somewhat surprise me earlier.
You are a laughingstock
Mr President, Mortimer is simply leaving you by the wayside.
Look how smug he was when he addressed you during the conference.
The country closest to his heart is and always will be France. For him the United States is merely a stooge nation in the service of the French.
Louis, your youth might excuse your impetuosity, but not your stupidity.
Without Mortimer, the United Sates wouldn't have made it this far and against all the odds, we are now a nation which everyone wants to rally around.
Whether you understand it or not, it is set to strive ahead.
Speak about Mortimer's plan
President Washington, I regret that my situation is contrary to yours, especially as I really do respect you.
Me too, Louis.
Let us not mix business and emotion.
Understood.
I've just come from a meeting with Sir Gregory and his supporters. They are all rallying against Mortimer's project.
That is to be expected.
Great Britain, the Kingdom of Spain and Sicily, the Kingdom of Prussia , the Holy Empire, the Kingdom of Portugal, of Bohemia and of Hungary.
I know, Louis. I know...
The coalition against France also gives me cause for concern.
I'm certainly not saying that, on paper, Mortimer's plan seems very viable.
Lie
Mr President, Lord Mortimer treats you purely and simply like the least of his pawns. He gives you no explanation and then commits you to a project from which you have nothing to gain.
But you know that more than I do.
Is that what siding with Mortimer is all about?
I must confess that I don't entirely understand William lately.
Your side is going to lose
Look at a map of the world, Mr President.
You have no chance. Your only ally in Mortimer's plan is France and look at the noose tightening around it. All of Europe is rising against it right now.
France has no chance.
That's where you're wrong, Louis.
I expect no direct support from France. That is not their role.
What do you mean?
You ought to have come with us, Louis, I would have been pleased to explain everything to you.
But... I...
I know, it's beyond you.
I do not expect any direct support from France. It is not their role.
Anyway, you haven't really said what you wanted to say.
Tell me, Louis, what have you come here to sell me?
You should join Holm!
And why would I do that?
Let's shake his faith in Mortimer
This type of meeting might be familiar to you but for me, I must admit, Mr President, it's all a bit over my head.
It's only natural, Louis.
But you are managing rather well for a first-timer.
You've chosen the wrong allies, that's all.
I hope my mother doesn't hold it against me if I've made a mistake.
Anyway, if Lord Mortimer does succeed, it would be no mean feat.
Did he tell you what he would gain from it?
What do you mean?
Well, Mortimer's plan has been meticulously prepared for many years, I imagine.
Of that you can be sure.
It's only natural.
And his plan leaves nothing to chance.
No... that's what...
He never commits his own fortune. Let alone his reputation, since you're the one who takes center stage here.
In fact...
Whether he wins or loses, everything is arranged so that he comes out of it intact.
No... I...
Ah, you've got to hand it to him, though, he's a master at putting together a plan which puts himself at no risk.
That's true.
Don't worry... he... you can trust him.
Of course.
I'll bet he has invested in a river transport company on the Mississippi, or somewhere like that.
It's true, I had never thought about what he might have to gain.
Out of duty to my mother
You owe it to my mother.
She helped you in your early days, she supported you when you needed it.
I am certain she'd be against this plan.
Do you know who introduced me to Sarah all those years ago?
Lord Mortimer!
Do you know who advised Sarah to start up a chapter of the Golden Order with me in the United States?
Lord Mortimer?
You see my point, then?
I have a lot of respect for your mother, Louis, but my allegiance is to Lord Mortimer.
Blackmail him over the laudanum!
I regret to have to resort to such extreme measures but if you really care about your career, Mr President, I must ask you to follow me.
I beg your pardon, Louis?
Do I detect a threat in your voice, my boy?
You are addicted to Laudanum. We both know that this is a powerful opiate that you take on a daily basis to excess.
If you don't want it to be disclosed publicly, I entreat you to change sides, Mr President.
Louis, I was wrong about you, you learn even quicker than I thought.
Unfortunately, the fact that you are here trying to blackmail me, only makes me cringe even more.
You are now walking a dangerous path, young man.
I would never give in to this sort of tactic.
Do you have any persuasive arguments?
You owe me one!
Well, when you came looking to me for help, I gave it to you.
Now I'm the one asking you for help.
I need you, Mr President.
Louis, I understand what you mean but, even so, the favour you did is not comparable to what you are now asking me to do.
I only asked you to look after a young lady for ten minutes.
You are asking me to commit the future of my country.
I know, but I'm not asking without reason, nor to a man without honor !
You are blunt Louis, But I do acknowledge that I owe you a favor.
Because you are already allied to Emily against France.
Yet, hearing you speak, anyone would think that your closest ally is France.
Louis, I don't know...
Of course, you intend to restore and foster an exchange with England.
We both know what that means. It would weaken France's impact on American soil.
From there to relinquishing your agreements with France, is just one simple step.
You've scored a point, Louis.
Go on, I'm listening.
Tell me what Sir Gregory has to offer that I don't already have with Lord Mortimer.
Keep what you already have.
The question is less about what you would gain, Mr President, and more about what you would keep.
After this, you could be in danger of losing everything. Your political career for example.
Don't risk it all on such a wild wager.
Louis, this type of argument is just not going to motivate me to change sides.
I've spent my whole life taking action when everyone was telling me to remain conservative. My choices will not be governed by fear.
You would be able to win colonies
What would you say to winning a few colonies?
I am sure that Sir Gregory would be prepared to discuss the acquisition of new territories.
No thanks, Louis, I'm not interested.
Colonies bring with them their own thorny problems and thus I prefer to focus on the consolidation of American territory.
A small fortune
Don't worry about that, Mr President.
Needless to say, Sir Gregory will be very generous.
I beg your pardon, Louis?
Are you talking about money?...
Do you really believe that money could possibly motivate me to follow you? Is that the image you have of me?
Don't take it the wrong way. You must...
Please be so gracious as to not tell me how I should receive your clumsy bribe, Louis.
No, money does not motivate me at all.
If that is all you have to offer, then I believe we are finished here.
It is in the best interest of the American people
You are a man of conviction, Mr President.  You would never make a choice that could cost the American people very dearly.
If Mortimer falls, he will bring the United States down with him.
Haven't the American people suffered enough?
I would never do anything that would put my people in danger.
Exactly. Therefore, choose your allies wisely, sir.
I must admit your arguments do make sense, Louis.

Mr President, it seems Lord Mortimer would rather see Louisiana become French and not American.
Sir Gregory proposes that Louisiana go to you.
What? You would be prepared to hand it over to me?
It is certainly a possibility.
But for that you must not side with Mortimer at the conference.
I see.
Peace.
By following Sir Gregory, you'll be sure to be on the right side of the bayonets, Mr President.
Sir Gregory is encouraging all his partisans to go to war against Lord Mortimer's supporters.
Do you really want to go to war again?
Certainly not.
I would not allow it.
GOOD OUTCOME - WASH SAYS HE WILL VOTE FOR HOLM
Louis, you've convinced me. I congratulate you for your performance because I didn't think it could happen.
I merely exposed the facts to you.
Don't spoil everything with your false modesty, now. You really were very good, and that's that.

This may well arouse Lord Mortimer's wrath, but I must put the United States before anything else.

I shan't keep you any longer.

I hope Sir Gregory has more tricks up his sleeve than you do.  Because I regret to inform you that, as far as politics is concerned, you've got a lot to learn.
But you are still young, so don't worry.
On that note, I would like to get some sleep. Please leave me now.
Good night, Mr President.
Louis?
Louis, the conference is about to start any minute. This is not the time to be...
Dammit! What's going on?
I don't exactly know, Mr President. I was looking for my mother and I came upon this body.
My God, you don't think Sarah did it, do you?
No
No, I don't think so. Why would she have attacked a servant?
Yes
Unfortunately, I'm afraid I...
How awful!... What has your mother gotten herself into now?
If only I knew, Mr President.
Protect her reputation
Mr President, you really shouldn't get involved. Please be on your way, I'll take care of this.
You didn't come this way and you didn't see anything.
You are right. It's for the best.
If Sarah did that, I don't know what kind of hornet's nest she's kicked open, but I do wish you luck, my friend.
If no one saw you, I'd advise you not to get involved, Louis.
So that no one will accuse you of the murder.
Darn! The conference is starting!
Time is of the essence, sort this out and join us as quickly as you can in the conference room. Everyone will be expecting you.
Mr President, this is not really the right time and I didn't come for that...
Your mother's seat cannot remain vacant. You must replace her while she's still missing.
Your mother and I were to support Mortimer in his project. I don't know what the subject is but the future of our countries depends on it.
Given the importance of all this to Mortimer, he won't let the conference begin without you.
So, if you don't want more servants coming looking for you, I'd advise you to  join us quickly and to put a brave face on it.
The best favor you can do for yourself, Louis, and for Sarah, is to come and support Mortimer's project at the conference.
You can count on me!
Don't worry, you can count on me, Mr President.
I shall help you with Mortimer's project. As soon as I've finished up here.
Good, Louis. Sarah would be proud of you!
I'll stall them while you are on your way, but make haste.
Don't commit yourself to anything
Look, I don't mind following you, but I should warn you, I have no idea what this is all about .
So I can't make any promises as to what I might do.
I shall make my decision after the debate, when the time comes.
Ah... very well...
As you wish. You will see once you hear everything.  But given the situation, I think you will have everything to gain by joining Mortimer's side.
I'm going! Don't be long.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Louis, I've been looking for you.
Have you managed to find your mother?
No, don't go imaging such things, Louis, really.
Unfortunately not.
I'm making progress.
I'm making progress but she seems to keep moving from one hideout to another.
Time is short, unfortunately. The conference is about to begin. Sarah was supposed to be here.
Her seat must not remain vacant. Could you replace her, just until we've found her?
That's not what I came here for.
I understand but something important is going to happen during the conference... 
Your mother and I were supposed to back Mortimer's project. I don't know the exact subject but the future of our countries is at stake.
Don't worry, when Sarah turns up, she'll take her seat.
When my mother turns up again, first and foremost she'll go away to get some medical care... 
He can count on me
You can count on me, Mr President.
As long as my mother is unable to be present herself, I shall voice her opinions... 
Thank you, Louis. I knew I could count on you.
Don't commit yourself to anything
Look, I'm willing to follow you, however, I must warn you, I am not up familiar with the agenda.
I can therefore make no promises as to my position. 
I shall decide accordingly when the time comes.
Very well, I understand.
I only hope you don't put your mother in a delicate situation.
Come, we are expected.
Louis, I've been looking for you.
Have you managed to find your mother?
No, don't go imaging such things, Louis, really.
Unfortunately not.

"Dear Mr President,"
I am returning my answer as quickly as I can... 
We already spoke about it before you left, but I note that things have not improved... 
I urge you to follow my advice and to stop taking Laudanum immediately!
I am already looking for a substitute, but I am afraid you won't wait.
Your excessive consummation is in danger of definitively impairing your chances of securing your next mandate.
Your addiction is jeopardizing the exercise of your office and duties, my friend.
I regret I see no other solution but to stop your daily intake.
Yours sincerely,
Dr W.Thomton"

Ah, Monsieur de Richet! You wouldn't have seen Duke Manuel by any chance, would you?
Yes, in the dining-room
I... I just ran into him. He was heading for the dining-room.
Ah!  Thank you...
No
No, I'm sorry. I don't know where he is.
Very well, I shall wait for him in that case.
I was going to ask you the same question...
I wanted to speak to him but no one will open the door. I'm not sure he's in there.
If I want to pass through, I'll have to get WÃ¶llner out of the way...
Have you tried entering?
Perhaps he didn't hear you. Did you try entering?
No, of course not...  It would not be proper, after all!
Make him leave
Oh, now wait a minute! Yes,  I remember now...  I think I saw him in the garden!
In the garden? No, you must be mistaken, I've just come from there. I would have seen him...
Oh...  I must have been someone else then...
Most certainly.  Oh well, he's bound to turn up at some point. I'll wait.
Impossible to get through with him glued in front of the door...  I'll have to find another way into Godoy's room.
Make up a story to get through
Excuse me but I must fetch a letter for the Duke.
Very well, sir. You may pass.
Make him search somewhere else.
I've searched all over the manor, but I can't find him.
One thing's for sure, Monsieur de Richet, he's neither in his room nor on this floor. I've just looked all over...
I propose we both look for him. The first to find him tells the Duke that the other is also looking for him. Agreed?
Perfect, let's do that! I shall have a look in the library!
If you find the Duke before me, tell him I want to speak to him.
Yes, let's proceed as you say...
Thank you, Monsieur de Richet.
Right, now be a good boy and go look somewhere else...
Force your way through
Excuse me, Monsieur von WÃ¶llner, I'd like to get past...
Sorry, sir, but you will have to wait your turn!  I, too, would like to speak to the Duke...
Great...  now he's not gonna let me pass.
Move away
He won't let me by...  I'll have to find another way of getting into the damn room!!
Let's think... Come on! So...  apart from the door...  the only other way is by the balcony...
Ah, Monsieur de Richet! You wouldn't have seen Duke Manuel by any chance, would you?
Yes, in the dining-room
