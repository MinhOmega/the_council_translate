Oh! Your arm! How awful!
Now she notices it?
I... I had an accident, forget about it...
If you say so...
You've been drinking...
Why aren't I surprised?....
Do you think you'll find the solution in alcohol?
Get out of here, Louis!
I told you not to come in!
I just wanted to explain that...
I don't want to hear why you let me kill your mother...
Well, it turns out she isn't my mother...
It makes no difference to me!
How far will her anger go
First your sister. Now my mother...
How far will your anger go?
Do... Do you really think I'm not suffering?
She will pay one day
Everyone pays one day or another, Emily...
And you already have a hefty debt......
If you think you can frighten me...
Go! Leave me!
(In tears)
You know nothing! You understand nothing!
On the contrary!
If you'd given me more time, if you had listened to me...
It was impossible for me to know.
Of course it wasn't...
I know I can't really ask... But please, forgive me...for what I have done...
Everything that goes on in here is... is much bigger than you and me.
You made your choices and... and now you're going to have to take responsibility for them.
You know full well that getting yourself worked up like this, is not going to help!
It won't make any difference...
It won't bring Emma back.
Forget... I couldn't give a damn if it makes any difference! I only want to not think of anything...
And then get out of here!
I told you not to come in!
Emily... I only want to talk...
I understand that you're upset after everything that...
You understand... You understand nothing!
Listen... We're going through a difficult time. Even I'm dumbfounded and I...
Dumbfounded?... "Dumbfounded"!
Do you want to know how I feel?
[MIND READING]
Dear God, how could I have done this... I want it to stop!
Go with her
Yes, I would like to…
My whole life has just gone up in smoke!
Everything I believed in gone, blown apart!
I have killed a part of myself!!
Yes, I... I know how you feel.
No.... I don't think so!
I've found out that my mother has been lying to me all my life.
That she's not my real mother.
And I let you finish her off instead of me...
And I killed her.
I told her to go far... far away
Why, Louis?
What have we done to deserve this?
I don't think that's the question.
We haven't done anything, only made choices for which we must accept responsibility.
And what if I no longer have the strength to do so?
But you do.
It's just too early for you to feel it.
But believe me...
Make her talk.
Go on, I'm listening...
Go on, I'm listening!
Do you think you're in the middle of an interrogation?
Nobody gives a bloody damn about how I am...
She is overwhelmed with guilt
I know you regret what happened to your sister, I...
It's gone too far.
I would never have come if I had known... I didn't want to hurt her...
We have...
I have lost everything...
I am all alone now.
She is drunk
You've had too much to drink, Emilly...
Oh, shut up!
If you're just going to talk nonsense, you may as well keep quiet!
Look, I want to help you...
Oh, I'm so touched!
We've all lost something here...
All this... Everything that's happened... it's a nightmare!!!
I want to wake up...
Emily... Calm down... Put down that glass and...
I must tell you something important..
Emily, listen to me...
I'm fed up with talking...
It's about what's happening here...
It's about Mortimer and Holm... They're...
I know you're telling the truth about Mortimer and Holm...
I know they are Daemons...
That's not all...
Go on...
I'm one of them, Emily. I'm a Daemon, too.
I know.
But... but how?
Sir Gregory stopped by to tell me.
I... he wanted to bid me welcome.
I don't understand...
Welcome... to the family.
I... You...
You're his daughter?
Mortimer's daughter, Louis.
What... No... No, that's no... that's not possible!
If...
So we have...
We are brother and sister?
This is too much, Louis... much too much for me, Louis!
I can't look myself in the mirror.
I should never have spent the night with you...
So that means Emma was my sister as well!
Yes, Louis... we have all sinned!
That makes you... my sister?
Yes...
Just the thought of the night when I suggested that we... I feel so ashamed, Louis.
And that means Emma was your sister too.
Thankfully, she will never know...
No... No... it's... it's...
How could I have ever known?
Emily...
No...
I didn't know!
Oh shit... I spent the night with my own sister...
I was attracted to you from the moment we first spoke, on the boat.
Now I understand why...
Do you realize what that means?
I'm a monster!
I am attracted too...
And I am one, as well...
When I think of my feelings for you, I...
We've committed an error.
We couldn't have known... We made a mistake, damn it!
That feeling...
It hurts all of a sudden!
Success
I... she... she's there, I... I can feel her inside me...
She's trying to read my thoughts!
Emily... Don't do that! Get out of my mind, please.
Let me remind you that it's forbidden between Daemons.
I... sorry, Louis.
I didn't want to...
(default)
You?... You too?...
I love you, Louis. I can't bear it... It hurts so terribly!
I...
I don't know what to say, I...
I think it's gonna take time.
I agree with you...
It was a mistake...
Are you reading my thoughts?
Emily!
I... I'm sorry... excuse me...
I have a sister.
It's... It's very strange for me too...
A sister for a brother...
Yes...
Yes...
I must get some rest... I must ask you to leave me now...
Alright but don't finish that bottle...
Don't start, now!
I would like to get some sleep...
I'll be leaving you then.
I... Thank you, Emily.
Oh! Your arm! How awful!
Now she notices it?
I... I had an accident, forget about it...

Emily?
Can I come in?
I... no... it's not a good time.
Not right now, leave me alone.
Insist.
I can tell from your voice that... that there's something wrong...
Let me in.
We have to talk, Emily!
I said no, goddamn you!
Enter anyway
Leave.
Leave.
Oh! Your... Your arm! It's awful!
Now she notices?
I... an accident, it's nothing serious...
We have to talk...
I was just wondering...
Uh-oh... what's she smiling for?
Right, I shall begin.
It's going to be an awful lot for you to take in on just one day....
But.... I must tell you that I'm a Daemon too.
Excuse me?
I know that you are too... Gregory told me everything during my convalescence.
Your convalescence?
Long story short...
For starters I'm not Emily.
What?
You can't be disappointed...
You're the one who chose... must I remind you?
If only I'd known.
I made a huge mistake!
She should be where you are now!
Well, it's too late now.
You rotten bitch!
Don't make her mad.
I had a fifty-fifty chance...
A fifty-fifty chance of getting the right one: me!
That remains to be proven.
Careful Louis... Don't be hurtful...
You're better off for it, believe me...
There, now there are no secrets between us.
Fine... whatever you say.
And that isn't all... I'm also Mortimer's daughter.
You understand... what that means I hope...
I...
Er...
That's right. I am a Daemon too, and I am your sister.
And we also slept together!
But don't be too hard on yourself...
It's a bit unnatural when you think about it, but then you couldn't know...
This way at least, everything stays in the family, it's for the best...
It mustn't prevent us from living out our affair in the open, however.
Our affair?
Have you lost your mind?
I'm far too soft on you... I'll let you have everything, of course!
So don't be nasty, if you don't mind.
Calm her down.
She's not all there, it's... it's plain to see.
Yes... true, it's... it's been a long day.
Yes... You ought to get some rest.
You can sleep there, you know that, right?
Although... thinking about it.
Don't be taken in
Emma... It doesn't make sense...
The mere thought makes me sick!
Shut up!
You always have to ruin everything!
But not this time, do you hear me?
Best remain discreet for the time being.
We shall go see Father later and tell him everything...
Of course he'll be disappointed because he bet it would be Emily, I think...
Wow, she is completely mad!
But I think he will be proud of me when all is said and done.
She's talking to herself...
She can't even see me...
He loves me... oh, he loves me not...
Yes, we'll have to tell Father all about this...
But I don't want to live on this island, it's too cold...
There's no point in insisting anymore...
I'm going, Emma.
Yes, I'll see you later....
Oh! Your... Your arm! It's awful!

My dear Giuseppe,
As my health does not allow me to honor Sir Holm's invitation to go to Lord Mortimer's, 
I should be grateful if you would sit at a conference on my behalf.
Naturally, you will give my thanks to your hosts.
Consolidate our agreements with Sir Gregory and let him know that his venture regarding Cardinal-Bishop Chiaramonti is following its course.
I have every confidence in you.
May God bless and protect you
S. S. Giovanni Angelo Braschi
P.S.: Do not use your personal stamp when writing to me. Instead use the one with my motto on it.

My dear Giuseppe,
I know you are on your way to Lord Mortimer's residence,
I hope you have a good trip, even though you are obliged to cross the French countryside at present very agitated.
Know that this mission is crucial, my friend.
May God bless and protect you.
S. S. Giovanni Angelo Braschi

...........EH HBCF
Right... it's time I got started.
Let's see what I can find here to help me write that letter.
I have no means to validate my forgery, so I'd better take my time with it and not make any mistakes.
There are two letters from the pope on the desk. I should be able to get a clue or two by checking how well they correspond to each other.
And here are three stamps, all are different...
Read the letters on the desk
Read the first letter
Read the second letter
Put down the letters
Choose the contents of the letter
Right... Let's start writing...
Lord Mortimer asked me to discredit Sir Gregory and to announce Piaggi's final vote in his favor.
As an introduction... “Your Holiness, thank you for your trust...
Discredit Holm
“It turns out, now that I'm here, that I find Lord Mortimer's projects grant us many more advantages, in comparison to what Sir Gregory had suggested.”
“We are talking about the future of the Holy See”... There, that should be enough to justify the change of vote!
Discredit Mortimer
“As we informed Sir Gregory, it is of absolute necessity that Lord Mortimer's projects do not come to fruition.”
“We are talking about the future of the Holy See.”
Discredit both
“It even appears that Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory both have access to obscure, superior forces to help them reach their ends.”
“I think that the Papal States, for the sake of their own preservation, ought to condemn this practice of conferences in the future.”
Choose a stamp for the letter
I noticed something about the stamp
In one of the letters, the pope asked Piaggi to change, and to stop using his personal stamp...
He asked him to use the one with the pope's motto on it...
I know that
And I remember that...
Floret in Domo Domini
The pope's motto...
Must be in Latin...
Go back
Look at the stamp on the right
I have already read a letter from Piaggi...
I've already seen this seal...
Yes, it looks like the stamp that Piaggi applied to the letter he handed to me!
Compare with Piaggi's letter
Piaggi once gave me a sealed letter...
It had the same seal on it, I remember now!
Look at the inscription on the stamp
"Giustizia, Misericordia e Umiltà." Boy, I gotta brush up my foreign languages.
Translate
I think it's in Italian: “Justice, Mercy and Humility”.
Go back
Use this one
Go back
Look at the stamp in the middle
I've already read a letter from Piaggi!
I remember the seal that Piaggi used for the letter he confided me with...
I don't recognize this one...
Compare with Piaggi's letter
This seal is different to the one Piaggi used for the letter he gave me...
Yes, I'm certain of it...
Look at the inscription on the stamp
On it is written...
"Floret in Domo Domini"
Translate
Latin.
“It blooms in the house of God”
Go back
Use this one
Go back
Look at the stamp on the left
I've already read a letter from Piaggi!
When Piaggi handed me that letter to give to my mother, I noticed the seal...
And this one is clearly different...
Compare with Piaggi's letter
Now... I distinctly remember the seal that Piaggi used on the letter he gave me...
This isn't the same stamp.
Look at the inscription on the stamp...
A circle with a cross inside.
Use this one
Go back
Go back
Write a secret code
There's a kind of code composed of six letters that they always write under the dates of their correspondence.
According to Mortimer, it's got something to do with Piaggi's tattoo...
I guess I'll have to write one for today's date.
Now, ideally it'd be better to do without it... but I'm gonna need to be extremely clever here!
Today the date is 24.01.1793  |ConvertLetterCode(6)

Go back
Change the last letter
Start again from the beginning
Think about the logic of the code
In the letters from the pope, there are 6 letters just below the date.
2 just below the month, 4 others below the year.
Piaggi's tattoo... It must be used to establish a connection between the letter of the concentric circle and the numbers shown in the middle.
Think!
Some figures are the same in both codes... yet they correspond to different letters.
The day is not translated. That must be the key to the code!
Go back
Do without the code
I could pretend that the code got erased during the voyage, as if the letter arrived in really bad condition...
That would be perfectly understandable given that it's traveled across the seas, right?

It's finished... I just need to put the seal on it.
To hell with it... I just hope everything is perfect...or, well, close enough.
Right... it's time I got started.
Let's see what I can find here to help me write that letter.

“It turns out, now that I'm here, that I find Lord Mortimer's projects grant us many more advantages, in comparison to what Sir Gregory had suggested.”
“We are talking about the future of the Holy See”... There, that should be enough to justify the change of vote!
Discredit Mortimer
“As we informed Sir Gregory, it is of absolute necessity that Lord Mortimer's projects do not come to fruition.”
“We are talking about the future of the Holy See.”
Discredit both
“It even appears that Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory both have access to obscure, superior forces to help them reach their ends.”
“I think that the Papal States, for the sake of their own preservation, ought to condemn this practice of conferences in the future.”
Choose a stamp for the letter
I noticed something about the stamp
In one of the letters, the pope asked Piaggi to change, and to stop using his personal stamp...
He asked him to use the one with the pope's motto on it...
I know that
And I remember that...
Floret in Domo Domini
The pope's motto...
Must be in Latin...
Go back
Look at the stamp on the right
I have already read a letter from Piaggi...
I've already seen this seal...
Yes, it looks like the stamp that Piaggi applied to the letter he handed to me!
Compare with Piaggi's letter
Piaggi once gave me a sealed letter...
It had the same seal on it, I remember now!
Look at the inscription on the stamp
"Giustizia, Misericordia e Umiltà." Boy, I gotta brush up my foreign languages.
Translate
I think it's in Italian: “Justice, Mercy and Humility”.
Go back
Use this one
Go back
Look at the stamp in the middle
I've already read a letter from Piaggi!
I remember the seal that Piaggi used for the letter he confided me with...
I don't recognize this one...
Compare with Piaggi's letter
This seal is different to the one Piaggi used for the letter he gave me...
Yes, I'm certain of it...
Look at the inscription on the stamp
On it is written...
"Floret in Domo Domini"
Translate
Latin.
“It blooms in the house of God”
Go back
Use this one
Go back
Look at the stamp on the left
I've already read a letter from Piaggi!
When Piaggi handed me that letter to give to my mother, I noticed the seal...
And this one is clearly different...
Compare with Piaggi's letter
Now... I distinctly remember the seal that Piaggi used on the letter he gave me...
This isn't the same stamp.
Look at the inscription on the stamp...
A circle with a cross inside.
Use this one

Write a secret code
There's a kind of code composed of six letters that they always write under the dates of their correspondence.
According to Mortimer, it's got something to do with Piaggi's tattoo...
I guess I'll have to write one for today's date.
Now, ideally it'd be better to do without it... but I'm gonna need to be extremely clever here!
Today the date is 24.01.1793  |ConvertLetterCode(6)

F - J

Start again from the beginning
Think about the logic of the code
In the letters from the pope, there are 6 letters just below the date.
2 just below the month, 4 others below the year.
Piaggi's tattoo... It must be used to establish a connection between the letter of the concentric circle and the numbers shown in the middle.
Think!
Some figures are the same in both codes... yet they correspond to different letters.
The day is not translated. That must be the key to the code!
Go back
Do without the code
I could pretend that the code got erased during the voyage, as if the letter arrived in really bad condition...
That would be perfectly understandable given that it's traveled across the seas, right?

It's finished... I just need to put the seal on it.
To hell with it... I just hope everything is perfect...or, well, close enough.
Sir Gregory?
Good day, Louis.
I think it would be good to talk.
Come in, please.
May I say how very sorry I am for what happened to Sarah.
Regardless of how she met her end, you grew up by her side and I wanted you to know that we have taken care of everything.
I... Yes, thank you.
Should you want to talk about it...
Again, thank you, but... I'd rather not.
We have found the body of the Duchess on the wharf...
I was going to inform you but I...
Don't worry. It's a lot to cope with for you, I do understand.
How are you feeling?
I don't know.
I understand.
I heard that William spoke to you at last about our nature, and our family.
It's a good thing. But you must be a bit shaken up.
That's the least you can say.
I bid you welcome among us, Louis.
Knowing William, he probably didn't go into any detail about our family, so if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
[MINDREADER]
Oh... I see he's already taught you how to read.
On the other hand, he obviously hasn't taught you our manners and customs.
You can read anyone's thoughts, but know that if you try to read the thoughts of a more experienced Daemon, he will sense you and might take offense of your lack of manners.
And he who is more experienced, is more dangerous.
Do you understand?
Yes, it can't get clearer than that.
Please excuse me.
How long have we been in existence?
How long has our family been in existence?
We have been here since the very beginning.
What do you mean? Exactly.
Are you trying to pull information out of me?
I... no, not at all. I was just wondering why that particular question seemed to disturb you.
Let us not insist then. You yourself weren't very convinced by the question, it seems.
How many are there in the family?
How many of us are there in the family?
There are eight brothers and sisters.
Why brothers and sisters?
What do you mean by brothers and sisters if we can change bodies?
You reason with logic.
We have retained the human habit.
When we first come into this world, we retain a certain attachment with out first envelope.
If we are born as a man we are brothers. If we are born as a woman, we are sisters.
But I must admit it has absolutely no real importance. They are just bodies.
Are there any other families?
Tell me then, are there any other families like ours?
There are officially seven.
But we are the oldest and therefore the most powerful.
Let us say no more...
Why does Mortimer rebel?
What's Lord Mortimer's problem?
I think he allows himself to be devoured by a need for recognition.
Has he always been like that?
More or less. But thinking about it, I believe that the birth of our youngest brother greatly accentuated his discomfort.
Is he jealous?
Do you think he's jealous?
I didn't realize you were so good at behavioral analysis.
Indeed, William certainly is prone to jealousy.
Finding one's place, notably in the eyes of our father, is not easy.
We all do what we can to succeed.
But I can't justify this perpetual rebellion against our rules.
Let's move on...
Is there a family head?
Is there a head of the family?
You'll see, you'll meet them all... of course, when you are ready.
They created us and set out the rules. Especially our Father.
As for our mother, she retired from the political stage we don't see her much anymore.
I think that all these questions simply bore her.
No questions...
I see... there is still much to learn.
Yes, it's true, you've got some catching up to do, my boy...
One thing you must understand, regarding any disagreements that might arise between William and myself, is his position with regard to mankind.
What do you mean?
For centuries we've been trying to help, and therefore preserve humanity.
Monarchies are simple and practical. They enable us to inspire humanity efficiently and I can't understand why William wants to replace them by democracy.
My father is right.
But, if your intention is not to dominate the human race, why not let them be master of their own destinies?
I perfectly understand this type of reaction from you, less from William.
The main thing you're lacking is time.
Man is transient... and one of his particularities is that he does not learn from the errors of his peers.
He uses up an incredible amount of energy building and destroying whatever he himself has put into place.
If we weren't here to help them, guide them, I sincerely believe that humanity would have become extinct by now.
We are eternal, Louis.
When we plan ahead, we do it for the long term.
That's more like despotism
I understand but that's more like tyranny, isn't it?
It's all a question of point of view.
From Man's point of view, I can understand he would have that impression if ever he found out.
But don't forget your true nature.
From the Daemons' point of view, in other words, ours, letting Man do as he thinks fit would equate to letting him race to his own demise.
But what about Man's freedom to choose?
That is Man's worst enemy, Louis.
Imagine a being that dies without reaching the age of adulthood, it remains a child.
We have to help him otherwise he will put himself in danger.
I understand
Indeed. From that point of view, it is better to... guide them.
It's rare for a novice daemon to manage to stop thinking like a man so quickly.
My father is wrong
Well, if our goal is to direct the future of humanity, it would work out easier through a monarchic system rather than a democracy.
I see you're a quick learner.
From now on, you know the fence that separates William from the rest of the family.
If only he would stop steering the destiny of certain countries like France or the United States of America in a more dangerous direction.
It has taken centuries for our family to establish relative peace between daemons.
Thanks to this policy, we have been able to decide everything by confining the other families to subordinate roles.
And now William is obsessed with disrupting everything.
Peace between Daemons? What do you mean?
I'm not talking about conflicts within our family. If that was all there was, everything would be fine.
But several other families, younger but nonetheless powerful, are trying to upset the balance.
At present, we dominate most of the major countries around the globe. But some families are pushing, via less influential countries, to gain ground.
Do you understand?
As best I can, yes.
When the times comes, you must take up a position on the political chess-board.
I only hope your father doesn't take you down with him.
Is he in danger?
Are you suggesting he might be in danger?
Well, Louis, our father's patience is not limitless.
If William ever goes too far, then yes, he will be in danger.
Am I in danger?
Are you trying to warn me that I am in danger?
Well, Louis, it will be up to you to choose.
Most of all, make sure you don't pick the wrong side. William has had all the time he needs to think about this.
You... do not.
I am sorry to say this but this first choice might well be of capital importance for your future.
Is this an invitation to follow you?
Are you offering me an alliance?
Louis, I do not believe that just because your father is mistaken all is lost for you.
You owe William nothing so there's nothing obliging you to support him.
I want you to make an informed choice.
Now go and see your father, see what he has to say and then think it over very carefully.
That's exactly what I intended to do.
Thank you, uncle.
Don't mention it, if I've been able to help you...
Go now.
Sir Gregory?
Good day, Louis.
I think it would be good to talk.

Thank you, uncle.
Don't mention it, if I've been able to help you...
Go now.
Louis... I was sure you would stay.
I'm proud of you, you have made the right choice.
You must have been disappointed not to have been able to speak to Sarah one last time.
I would have liked her to tell you herself...
Well, I guess I'll never know now...
True...
Even so, there is one more thing I haven't told you about her...
Sarah was... my daughter.
Wh... What? But...
It took great maturity to forgive your sister as you did.
She brought me up, I... I realize I owed her a lot.
We all make mistakes, as Sarah well knows.
Your decision not to see Sarah, your... sister, anymore...
I admire your determination.
She stole my life from me.
Even though I already owe her a lot, I... I don't want anything to do with her anymore.
You are the master of all your decisions from now on.
Now, you are definitively free from your sister's lies.
And from her in the process.
I respect that.
Given what she did to me, she deserved nothing less.
And apparently I'm not the only one.
I'd rather not talk about it...
I understand.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about her?
I thought that might be too many truths to absorb at one time.
I intended to tell you afterwards. You were in a hurry, so I made a decision.
You've been able to understand and choose for yourself.
As for your two other sisters, I kept your bond a secret for the same reason.
Gregory ignored my advice.
I wanted to give you time Louis, that's all.
How do you feel?
Hard to say...
Overwhelmed
... Confused about everything...
I have to admit, it's... it's been a lot to take in, in such a short amount of time.
Intrigued.
... Quite curious to find out more.
My whole way of thinking has been blown apart in just a couple hours.
Relieved
... At peace, really.
Oddly enough, I... I understand things that have happened to me better now...
Anxious
...Worried.
I wonder where it's all going to end.
What could be more normal?
It may have been a bit brutal, but you've just grown up, in a very short space of time.
From now on you can influence your own future.
I will guide you... We've all the time we need.
You're not the first to make me that offer.
What do you mean by that?
Your brother... Sir Gregory.
Gregory... Why am I not even surprised...
What did he say?
[MINDREADER]
...
He's not thinking about anything...
Louis! What have I taught you?
Never try to read the thoughts of a Daemon more experienced than yourself!
You cannot read my thoughts. Why won't you learn your lesson? This is the last time I will warn you.
He spoke to me about you
According to him, the family is a prickly subject for you...
He exaggerates.
I don't have problems with all our family, far from it.
I admit I find it difficult to follow the path set out before me sometimes.
I don't share their vision and they don't understand me.
They find you unstable...
He spoke to me about your Father
I've been given to understand that you have a ‘difficult' relationship with your father, isn't that right?
Let's just say we don't see things the same way.
I ended up finding out that there's a world outside the rules he has imposed on us.
Men could think the same thing of Daemons
It seems you find yourself in the same position that you've placed Men...
You were told what to do, what to think, and you found it unbearable.
Imagine if humanity finds out you secretly direct them.
How do you think they'd react?
Your analogy is not without substance.
But that's where it ends. Man's main flaw is his willingness to forget and to make the same errors time and again.
He can't help it, he is mortal.
Say nothing
He is worried for you
I think he's worried about you...
Worried? Hahahaha! Marvelous!
That's just like him...
You know, in a family like ours, we all have a role to play.
And his is to worry about everyone else.
Let me reassure you, there's no reason for him to worry about me.
Not even with regards to your father?
Like the relationship with your father for exemple?
I... it's sometimes complicated, I must admit.
I like to understand things, even if it means thinking outside the box...
In fact, that's a character trait that you seem to have inherited.
You haven't answered my question
You haven't answered about your father.
What did I tell you...
You are too curious, my son. Let time do its work.
Notice nothing
And what about your role?
And what's your role in this family?
Mine?
Oh, I think they probably feel I'm... the eternal naysayer, I suppose.
I think one mustn't be afraid of change and that it is healthy to challenge oneself at regular intervals.
And my role?
And what would my role be in all of this?
That's for you to decide... I'm not trying to force you, Louis.
I have high hopes for you, but the decision remains yours to make...
Change subjects, Louis!
Not much, he bid me welcome to the family, that's all...
Louis... Gregory is my brother. Always has been.
And he never goes anywhere... to say or do: "not much".
He must have told you that he's worried about me, that he wants to be there for you and that you ought to be wary of me.
Yes, something like that.
I don't impose anything on anyone, I'm just following my own path.
That said, Elizabeth didn't decide to stab herself nine times on her own, did she?
But where does it lead?
I suppose I should explain.
For centuries now, Daemons have emerged in and around great leaders all over the world.
But like true tyrants, they have governed with a iron fist in a studded glove!
That's the impression I get...
But you see, people's discontent is increasing, and they are too high up to hear it. They take themselves for gods!
Sooner or later, the people will turn against us, just as they have in the past.
Each time it's happened, many of us have died. We must master the humans yes, but gently.
And the best way of doing that is by allowing them a free choice, Louis...
Is that his project?
So that's your project?
He wants to give Men a free choice?
You really are trying to liberate Men?
Of course not entirely, no.
It is easier to keep control over people who slumber than people who are oppressed.
A man with nothing to lose is a dangerous man! Whereas if you give him a roof, food and entertainment, he will do whatever you want!
The best way of getting them to achieve something, is to make them think it was their idea.
For that, they have to feel as if they are free.
Hang on, what do you mean?
Look at the United States. From the start I introduced an idea that will change everything.
The idea that everything is possible. Everyone can become someone.
Is there anything more beautiful?
You mean it's not true?
Man can move mountains when he believes it is in his own interest.
And what nobler cause is there than his own freedom?
Have you any other examples?
Do you have any more examples?
Of course.
Let's speak about slavery!
Talk to me about slavery.
Well, take the slave trade, for example. It's an archaic practice that simply has to stop!
Today, black slaves of America work for free and in unbearable conditions.
Tomorrow, if you free the blacks and offer them work along with a salary, they will bless you for it.
Then, they will be integrated into the system. They will be taxable.
Once they are free, they will have to work for a roof, pay taxes and feed their families.
Maybe we could take away the civil rights of prisoners, for example.
In this way, we'll keep control of all those who respect the system and benefit from the others as workforce.
The emancipation of women?
And what would you propose for women?
They must be given the right to work and to vote!
Look, at the moment they don't work. They take care of raising children.
What a mistake!
We have to get them out of the house. Make them work!
In this way, not only will they become consumers, but they will also delegate the job of education to the system.
We could guide humanity from a young age.
Today, we are wasting too much time.
Let's speak of religions
Talk to me about religions.
They were initially my father's idea, and we have to admit now that they just don't work.
What obscurantism!
By harping on this concept of good and evil, guilt and redemption, look where Men are now.
Locked up in beliefs that should no longer exist.
It's time for Men to rediscover themselves and to take control of their lives. As they really are. Without any moral judgment.
Progress?
Tell me what you think about progress.
Progress is essential, Louis! It's the future!
Progress must liberate humanity from burdensome chores.
Progress must replace Man wherever his presence is not obligatory.
It creates both the desire and the need.
It will liberate women as soon as the machines are able to do all the chores in the home automatically. It will bring Men together by bringing a faster means of locomotion.
Look at the cultural revolution that printing brought about.
Let us say no more...
But the most important of all has already been laid. The foundation stone:
Freedom of speech. The first amendment of the constitution.
There must be opponents to every project. So above all, don't develop a one-track approach otherwise Man won't have enough room for expression to feel free.
If Man sees his chains, he will only want to break them.
How horrible, it's immoral!
But that's completely immoral!
Immoral? Louis! You surprise me...
Morality has nothing to do with it.
Morality is a concept that we invented ourselves to domesticate Man. Don't react like them.
Can't you see it's all within your grasp?
It's not very noble, if you ask me. But maybe you invented that concept too?
What will happen if I refuse to subjugate Men?
It will come naturally to you, my son.
But not with the aim of subjugation but rather to create the best balance possible.
You'll see. It comes to us all after a few centuries. I'm just trying to help you save some time.
They are perishable, Louis. They come and they go. They are mere butterflies that take themselves for gods.
If we give Men the feeling that they are free, I am convinced that they will exceed their limits.
And it is only from that condition that humanity shall rise up.
But do you want to dominate or raise humanity higher?
I want it to advance!
I want it to progress!
Man is our vessel. If he progresses, then so do we.
Wouldn't you like to know what we really are?
Who do you mean? Daemons?
Yes, us. Our species.
I've been searching for centuries, trying to find a way to explain the reason of our existence. But humanity is not yet evolved enough to make any progress on the subject.
I am convinced that the sciences will bring that knowledge someday!
So that's your objective, is it?
To understand who we are.
It's still manipulation!
I understand your goal but the change you propose is not really a significant one...
It is merely more smoke and mirrors.
You must understand that we directly depend on Men.
Consequently, we have to do our utmost to help them progress and to prevent them from killing each other.
Given the number of wars, it doesn't seem to be working
And you think that's been a success?
Humanity, it's almost always at war. And it's been this way forever.
Look, I'm not saying that the task is easy.
We've all had failures and at times we have even suffered from conflicts on our own side.
I'm doing my best to improve the situation.
Why not impose peace?
As we have the power to influence their will, why not impose the desire to live in peace?
We do exactly that, on a regular basis.
But a leopard cannot change its spots.
When the person that you inspired dies, you have to start all over again with the next one.
It's painstaking work Louis.
Why not teach them to be autonomous?
What proves that Men are unable to evolve without our control?
Look at history.
Every time Man tries to act on his own, he creates more problems than solutions.
You will understand better after a few centuries.
Why not, after all.
I see your point.
Our family clings to its privileges and to the past.
And that's how they are putting us in danger.
But time has come for change!
Now that you know your true nature, there are still a few things I need to teach you.
What do you mean exactly?
A new skill... and not the least, Louis.
It's about taking control of a person...
How do you do that?
I don't see how I could do that...
I shall help you the first time.
How is that possible?
How do you do it?
It's an anima resonance... How it works is still a bit unclear, even to us.
Like a wave or a sound?
That seems the most likely, yes.
In my opinion, Daemons are capable of tuning their psychic frequency to that of others.
That is why, for example, I tend to surround myself with deaf and dumb servants. The servants dressed in black.
I infiltrated them, I opened a channel between them and me, and then I deprived them of speech and hearing.
This way no other Daemon can turn them against me.
I'm ready
Ok, let's not waste any more time.
I deduce that you're impatient to master what's in store for you...
That is good.
I thought I'd mix business with pleasure for this first time...
What do you mean by that?
The conference will come to a close shortly, as you know.
Not that I'm fed up with archaic diplomacy, but it's time to ensure the success of this project.
To make this happen, I would like Piaggi to inform the Pope he has changed sides...
Rig the conference?
You... you're going to use your powers to alter the votes?
The real game is about to begin, Louis.
Up till now, the guests have been sizing each other up. From now on, it's time for Gregory and myself to play.
As well as you yourself, now.
Say nothing
Here is my plan.
I would like you to join his Eminence in his room.
Just play along... We'll see when the time comes.
Very well. And then?
You're going to have to trust me...
What we're going to do is painless for the human you are going to invade.
"Invade"?
Yes, you are going to enter his mind and take control.
You're going to influence his actions and his psyche.
But how?
Say nothing
Make him speak, then concentrate.
You must focus on him, in order to feel his thoughts.
Then, while speaking, you must link with him.
Once you're done, you will naturally find your way to the source and enter into his thoughts.
But what if I fail?
Trust in your instincts...
You just have to let yourself go. You have the skill, let your nature come to the fore.
You'll see...
If you fail, you'll be in for some light banter with his Eminence, that's all. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Very well...
Perfect.
Go now, the cardinal is in his room.
You will have to write a letter to the Pope as if Piaggi had written it himself.
In this letter, tell the pope that whatever happens during the conference, he must follow my propositions.
But be careful, in order to protect himself from counterfeiters, the Pope had Piaggi's hand tattooed with a symbol, to be sure of his identity.
You'll see when you're inside him, you'll understand.
Once it's written up, just bring it back to me and I'll send it off immediately.
Alright, I'll take care of it.
Louis... I was sure you would stay.
I'm proud of you, you have made the right choice.
You must have been disappointed not to have been able to speak to Sarah one last time.
I would have liked her to tell you herself...
Well, I guess I'll never know now...
True...
Even so, there is one more thing I haven't told you about her...
Sarah was... my daughter.
Wh... What? But...
It took great maturity to forgive your sister as you did.
She brought me up, I... I realize I owed her a lot.
We all make mistakes, as Sarah well knows.
Your decision not to see Sarah, your... sister, anymore...
I admire your determination.
She stole my life from me.
Even though I already owe her a lot, I... I don't want anything to do with her anymore.
You are the master of all your decisions from now on.
Now, you are definitively free from your sister's lies.
And from her in the process.
I respect that.
Given what she did to me, she deserved nothing less.
And apparently I'm not the only one.
I'd rather not talk about it...
I understand.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about her?
I thought that might be too many truths to absorb at one time.
I intended to tell you afterwards. You were in a hurry, so I made a decision.
You've been able to understand and choose for yourself.
As for your two other sisters, I kept your bond a secret for the same reason.
Gregory ignored my advice.
I wanted to give you time Louis, that's all.
How do you feel?
Hard to say...
Overwhelmed
... Confused about everything...
I have to admit, it's... it's been a lot to take in, in such a short amount of time.
Intrigued.
... Quite curious to find out more.
My whole way of thinking has been blown apart in just a couple hours.
Relieved
... At peace, really.
Oddly enough, I... I understand things that have happened to me better now...
Anxious
...Worried.
I wonder where it's all going to end.
What could be more normal?
It may have been a bit brutal, but you've just grown up, in a very short space of time.
From now on you can influence your own future.
I will guide you... We've all the time we need.
You're not the first to make me that offer.
What do you mean by that?
Your brother... Sir Gregory.
Gregory... Why am I not even surprised...
What did he say?
[MINDREADER]
...
He's not thinking about anything...
Louis! What have I taught you?
Never try to read the thoughts of a Daemon more experienced than yourself!
You cannot read my thoughts. Why won't you learn your lesson? This is the last time I will warn you.
He spoke to me about you
According to him, the family is a prickly subject for you...
He exaggerates.
I don't have problems with all our family, far from it.
I admit I find it difficult to follow the path set out before me sometimes.
I don't share their vision and they don't understand me.
They find you unstable...
He spoke to me about your Father
I've been given to understand that you have a ‘difficult' relationship with your father, isn't that right?
Let's just say we don't see things the same way.
I ended up finding out that there's a world outside the rules he has imposed on us.
Men could think the same thing of Daemons
It seems you find yourself in the same position that you've placed Men...
You were told what to do, what to think, and you found it unbearable.
Imagine if humanity finds out you secretly direct them.
How do you think they'd react?
Your analogy is not without substance.
But that's where it ends. Man's main flaw is his willingness to forget and to make the same errors time and again.
He can't help it, he is mortal.
Let's say no more...
He is worried for you
I think he's worried about you...
Worried? Hahahaha! Marvelous!
That's just like him...
You know, in a family like ours, we all have a role to play.
And his is to worry about everyone else.
Let me reassure you, there's no reason for him to worry about me.
Not even with regards to your father?
Like the relationship with your father for exemple?
I... it's sometimes complicated, I must admit.
I like to understand things, even if it means thinking outside the box...
In fact, that's a character trait that you seem to have inherited.
You haven't answered my question
You haven't answered about your father.
What did I tell you...
You are too curious, my son. Let time do its work.
Notice nothing
And what about your role?
And what's your role in this family?
Mine?
Oh, I think they probably feel I'm... the eternal naysayer, I suppose.
I think one mustn't be afraid of change and that it is healthy to challenge oneself at regular intervals.
And my role?
And what would my role be in all of this?
That's for you to decide... I'm not trying to force you, Louis.
I have high hopes for you, but the decision remains yours to make...
Change subjects, Louis!
Not much, he bid me welcome to the family, that's all...
Louis... Gregory is my brother. Always has been.
And he never goes anywhere... to say or do: "not much".
He must have told you that he's worried about me, that he wants to be there for you and that you ought to be wary of me.
Yes, something like that.
I don't impose anything on anyone, I'm just following my own path.
That said, Elizabeth didn't decide to stab herself nine times on her own, did she?
But where does it lead?
I suppose I should explain.
For centuries now, Daemons have emerged in and around great leaders all over the world.
But like true tyrants, they have governed with a iron fist in a studded glove!
That's the impression I get...
But you see, people's discontent is increasing, and they are too high up to hear it. They take themselves for gods!
Sooner or later, the people will turn against us, just as they have in the past.
Each time it's happened, many of us have died. We must master the humans yes, but gently.
And the best way of doing that is by allowing them a free choice, Louis...
Is that his project?
So that's your project?
He wants to give Men a free choice?
You really are trying to liberate Men?
Of course not entirely, no.
It is easier to keep control over people who slumber than people who are oppressed.
A man with nothing to lose is a dangerous man! Whereas if you give him a roof, food and entertainment, he will do whatever you want!
The best way of getting them to achieve something, is to make them think it was their idea.
For that, they have to feel as if they are free.
Hang on, what do you mean?
Look at the United States. From the start I introduced an idea that will change everything.
The idea that everything is possible. Everyone can become someone.
Is there anything more beautiful?
You mean it's not true?
Man can move mountains when he believes it is in his own interest.
And what nobler cause is there than his own freedom?
Have you any other examples?
Do you have any more examples?
Of course.
Let's speak about slavery!
Talk to me about slavery.
Well, take the slave trade, for example. It's an archaic practice that simply has to stop!
Today, black slaves of America work for free and in unbearable conditions. They are cooped up like animals and they are not integrated into society.
Tomorrow, if you free the blacks and offer them work along with a salary, they will bless you for it.
Then, they will be integrated into the system. They will be taxable.
Once they are free, they will have to work for a roof, pay taxes and feed their families.
Maybe we could take away the civil rights of prisoners, for example.
In this way, we'll keep control of all those who respect the system and benefit from the others as workforce.
The emancipation of women?
And what would you propose for women?
They must be given the right to work and to vote!
Look, at the moment they don't work. They take care of raising children.
What a mistake!
We have to get them out of the house. Make them work!
In this way, not only will they become consumers, but they will also delegate the job of education to the system.
We could guide humanity from a young age, Louis. Don't you see ?
Today, we are wasting too much time.
Let's speak of religions
Talk to me about religions.
They were initially my father's idea, and we have to admit now that they just don't work.
Louis, what obscurantism!
By harping on this concept of good and evil, guilt and redemption, look where Men are now.
Locked up in beliefs that should no longer exist.
It's time for Men to rediscover themselves and to take control of their lives. As they really are. Without any moral judgment.
Progress?
Tell me what you think about progress.
Progress is essential, Louis! It's the future!
Progress must liberate humanity from burdensome chores.
Progress must replace Man wherever his presence is not obligatory.
It creates both the desire and the need.
It will liberate women as soon as the machines are able to do all the chores in the home automatically. It will bring Men together by bringing a faster means of locomotion.
Look at the cultural revolution that printing brought about.
Let us say no more...
But the most important of all has already been laid. The foundation stone:
Freedom of speech. The first amendment of the constitution.
There must be opponents to every project. So above all, don't develop a one-track approach otherwise Man won't have enough room for expression to feel free.
If Man sees his chains, he will only want to break them.
How horrible, it's immoral!
But that's completely immoral!
Immoral? Louis! You surprise me...
Morality has nothing to do with it.
Morality is a concept that we invented ourselves to domesticate Man. Don't react like them.
Can't you see it's all within your grasp?
It's not very noble, if you ask me. But maybe you invented that concept too?
What will happen if I refuse to subjugate Men?
It will come naturally to you, my son.
But not with the aim of subjugation but rather to create the best balance possible.
You'll see. It comes to us all after a few centuries. I'm just trying to help you save some time.
They are perishable, Louis. They come and they go. They are mere butterflies that take themselves for gods.
If we give Men the feeling that they are free, I am convinced that they will exceed their limits.
And it is only from that condition that humanity shall rise up.
But do you want to dominate or raise humanity higher?
I want it to advance!
I want it to progress!
Man is our vessel. If he progresses, then so do we.
Wouldn't you like to know what we really are?
Who do you mean? Daemons?
Yes, us. Our species.
I've been searching for centuries, trying to find a way to explain the reason of our existence. But humanity is not yet evolved enough to make any progress on the subject.
I am convinced that the sciences will bring that knowledge someday!
So that's your objective, is it?
To understand who we are.
It's still manipulation!
I understand your goal but the change you propose is not really a significant one...
It is merely more smoke and mirrors.
You must understand that we directly depend on Men.
Consequently, we have to do our utmost to help them progress and to prevent them from killing each other.
Given the number of wars, it doesn't seem to be working
And you think that's been a success?
Humanity, it's almost always at war. And it's been this way forever.
Look, I'm not saying that the task is easy.
We've all had failures and at times we have even suffered from conflicts on our own side.
I'm doing my best to improve the situation.

You'll see when you're inside him, you'll understand.
Once it's written up, just bring it back to me and I'll send it off immediately.
Alright, I'll take care of it.
Do you really think we have a chance of winning?
A chance?
You don't know me very well, Louis.
We are going to win!
But it only takes one person to vote against us, and we'll have lost.
That's true. That's why none of them will.
Why? Because I have an asset that they do not...
Which is?...
You!
My friends, prepare yourselves, the conference is about to resume.
The time has come to lay down all our cards!
So, Louis? What was your first time like?
Bewildering, isn't it?
Here's your cursed letter.
Wöllner dropped in to see Piaggi.
He saw my body and wanted to take advantage of it being inert to get rid of me.
What? What are you saying?
I... I... I wanted to intervene but being in Piaggi's body, I... I was unable to stop him...
The slime bag poisoned me!
Good god! No! It can't be possible!!
Do you have an antidote?
Louis... when you are evil enough to use poison, the first thing you do is make sure there is no antidote...
Am I going to die?
Are you saying I'm condemned?
Well, let me think a moment...
You lie!
That's horseshit! You must know of a remedy. I mean, you've been around for centuries, you're a chemist!
You must know about poisons!
Yes, but I don't know everything...
The liquid was light green
The poison was greenish with a blue sheen.
Sardonyx, monkshood perhaps... henbane?
Louis...
Arsenic!
Louis!
What?
I think your best chance is to count on your Daemon nature.
I'm confident that you'll be able to resist the poison, whatever it is.
Look at yourself. You've already endured many trials, you'll be able to get through this one, I'm sure!
That's all you've got for me?
Your answer is to wait and see?
Have faith in yourself, Louis.
The same thing happened to me. I'm not saying it's going to be a barrel of laughs...
I'm condemned, aren't I...
That bastard, I'm gonna kill him for this...
No no no no no! You haven't the right... at least, not here.
That said, I can promise you he will pay dearly for this outrage.
Here's your letter.
I have to admit that the experience was utterly amazing.
Come, tell me more...
I almost threw up
Well, honestly, I... My stomach was just turning in circles.
Hahaha! That reminds me of my first time…
Can't wait for the next time!
Not much else to say, other than I've already developed a taste for it.
Delighted to hear it! Bear in mind that you will discover many new things by going from body to body.
Is it possible to go from one body to another several times?
With practice, yes.
Some of us have become masters in the art of bouncing from one body to another.
To the extent that they can't be found.
I had to do it twice
To tell you the truth, I didn't make it through the first time.
Well, that's quite normal on the first try.
No difficulty
Everything went as planned.
I didn't encounter any particular difficulties.
Well done you! On my first try, well, it took me three goes...
But you did it...
Gregory? What can I do for you?
I've just come to make sure dear Louis has all the information he needs.
Needs for what?
You are free to make your own choices, William?
I would like the same for him too.
There's nothing I want more, Gregory.
Your schemes will lead you to your demise, Brother.
Preserve Louis. He has nothing to do with all this.
The end of the conference approaches and this masquerade will soon be torn asunder.
Don't drag him down with you in your disgrace.
Johann infected Louis with poison to eliminate him before the conference, Gregory.
I... No, he didn't...
You know what that means?
No, wait!
There must be an explanation!
In MY residence!
He attacked MY son!
And Johann is mine!!
If he made the unforgivable error of attacking Louis, I will personally take care of him!
He will be gone by this evening!
How do you feel?
I want my revenge!
I want him to pay!
I can assure you he will be punished, I'll be firm.
But I must do it alone... He's my son.
I refuse to put Johann at your mercy.
Alright... Louis, you can trust him, Johann will have to take responsibility for his action.
For the moment, not so bad
The poison hasn't taken effect yet.
I don't feel anything in particular.
Good.
I hope your metabolism will react against the poison.
I'm afraid
I don't believe this, I'm going to die...
Don't say that, nothing is less certain. You'll make it through, Louis!
If you didn't know Johann had poisoned Louis, what did you come for?
I came to persuade you to let him choose.
Ye of little faith!
On the contrary, Brother.
Louis has just entered the family.
Give him a chance to find his place.
His place?
Under Father's reign, we all know what it is in advance!
What do you mean?
What place is that?
At the end of a leash, like all the others.
Say nothing
Don't listen to him, he's angry with our Father.
And with good reason!
He governs us in the same way he governs humanity...
Through fear and submission!
Same old tune...
When will you understand that it's necessary to impose order for things to move forward properly?
You are under his thumb and proud of it! Open your eyes, for crying out loud!
His whole system has become outdated and he's too old to see it.
He will lead us to our demise!
Here he goes with another of his grand speeches...
William has always been fond of staging big scenes. It's his theatrical side.
You can say that again
Does he have an inferiority complex?
I've told him time and time again, Louis.
He always has to take it one step too far.
Say nothing
How dare y...
You are blind, Brother. Even if the evidence bit you on the nose, you still wouldn't see it.
I feel sorry for you.
Tea is drunk hot or not at all, William! When will you learn?
It's too bitter!
You shouldn't let it infuse so long.
I knew you'd be coming along... You are so predictable.
Methodical, more like.
Things must be accomplished in the right order if we want the world to keep turning as it does.
And too bad for the consequences?
Whatever the consequences?
What do you mean?
Let's say it hardly leaves any room for free will, does it?
It's the adult's responsibility to provide education for their children, Louis.
Our family only ensures, through its experience, that Daemons do not lose themselves in rash decision-making
It resembles an autocratic regime.
When you speak of the “right order”, I can't help hearing “your order”.
Louis, don't you think that by now we have acquired a certain experience?
Don't you think that we are the best placed to know what the “right order” should be by now?
I mostly understand that even with the best of intentions, this kind of talk could well be misinterpreted.
Every powerful man has had to speak in this way at some stage.
That doesn't mean they were right or that they achieved great things.
Take the Kings of France, for example, they weren't all good monarchs.
But what's he afraid that Mortimer will do to me?
You came here to warn me, sir.
To advise you.
Advise me against my Father.
Why?
I think you are capable of deciding for...
You haven't answered my question.
Why warn me against my Father? What are you afraid he will do to me?
Well, I wouldn't want him to lead you into I-don't-know-what absurd adventure in which...
You act as though I were in danger...
I agree with Louis, Gregory. You are trying to pass me off as the villain about to devour poor Louis.
That's's not funny, William!
I won't let him follow you!
You see, Louis, Gregory came here to make you change your mind.
It's time for things to change. I acknowledge Father has done many good things for humanity...
But his time is over, and now he must pass on the torch.
That's enough!
There, Louis! That's the pathetic example your Father has to offer.
I really am sorry about what happened to you.
You don't know our family yet. We can't have given you a very good impression but bear in mind that we are all against William's project.
On the contrary!
If he insists on going through with it, we will have no other choice than to intervene by force.
Consequently my dear Louis, you're going to have chose sides. I would much rather have met you in different circumstances...
There you are, Louis.
See what happens when you don't follow their orders to the letter.
Louis, I'm afraid the time to decide is now.
If you follow William, he will drag you down with him.
If, on the other hand, you support me, I can assure you that nothing will happen to you.
You won't be mixed up in your father's errors.
The masks are off.
I offer you liberty. He obliges you to choose. And shamelessly asks you to betray your own father.
That is their true face...
Right, before I answer, I'd better think it over very carefully.
Do I intend to embrace my Daemon nature and take my place on the chess-board?
Do I stay out of it and do my utmost to stop them?
Or do I renounce my nature and do all I can to stay human?
I AM A DAEMON
It's useless trying to resist my true nature. I am a Daemon, may as well accept it, the sooner the better.
Even if I continue to live as a human, all my friends and acquaintances will inevitably end up dying... and I'll be left on my own, forever.
I am a Daemon and I have to behave like one, the sooner the better!
I AM A MAN
I was born a man, I... I grew up as such!
Finding out that I'm a Daemon makes no difference.
I refuse to let them manipulate humanity the way they do!
They're gonna ask me to choose between them, I'll just have to go with the lesser evil of the two.
But they'd better not count on me to keep my word... I'll bring them all down!
So?
What do you choose, Louis?
JOIN FORCES WITH MORTIMER
I shall follow my Father, Sir Gregory.
Very well. You can't say I didn't warn you.
Please don't take offense, but I just can't turn my back on him.
That said, if he turns his back on me, I won't be slow in sticking a dagger between his shoulder blades...
JOIN FORCES WITH HOLM
Father, I'm sorry but if I'm going to follow my instincts, I can't in good conscience follow you.
Wh... But...
I hope you won't take it personally...but I prefer to support Sir Gregory.
Very well! You have made your choice!
It's time we finished what we started, Brother!
The final vote of the conference over the acquisition of Louisiana will take place in a few hours.
I propose you gather your troops and prepare to close the debate.
That's what I was going to suggest.
So, Louis? What was your first time like?
Bewildering, isn't it?
Here's your cursed letter.
Wöllner dropped in to see Piaggi.
He saw my body and wanted to take advantage of it being inert to get rid of me.
What? What are you saying?
I... I... I wanted to intervene but being in Piaggi's body, I... I was unable to stop him...
The slime bag poisoned me!
Good god! No! It can't be possible!!
Do you have an antidote?
Louis... when you are evil enough to use poison, the first thing you do is make sure there is no antidote...
Am I going to die?
Are you saying I'm condemned?
Well, let me think a moment...
You lie!
That's horseshit! You must know of a remedy. I mean, you've been around for centuries, you're a chemist!
You must know about poisons!
Yes, but I don't know everything...
The liquid was light green
The poison was greenish with a blue sheen.
Sardonyx, monkshood perhaps... henbane?
Louis...
Arsenic!
Louis!
What?
I think your best chance is to count on your Daemon nature.
I'm confident that you'll be able to resist the poison, whatever it is.
Look at yourself. You've already endured many trials, you'll be able to get through this one, I'm sure!
That's all you've got for me?
Your answer is to wait and see?
Have faith in yourself, Louis.
The same thing happened to me. I'm not saying it's going to be a barrel of laughs...
I'm condemned, aren't I...
That bastard, I'm gonna kill him for this...
No no no no no! You haven't the right... at least, not here.
That said, I can promise you he will pay dearly for this outrage.
Here's your letter.
I have to admit that the experience was utterly amazing.
Come, tell me more...
I almost threw up
Well, honestly, I... My stomach was just turning in circles.
Hahaha! That reminds me of my first time…
Can't wait for the next time!
Not much else to say, other than I've already developed a taste for it.
Delighted to hear it! Bear in mind that you will discover many new things by going from body to body.
Is it possible to go from one body to another several times?
With practice, yes.
Some of us have become masters in the art of bouncing from one body to another.
To the extent that they can't be found.
I had to do it twice
To tell you the truth, I didn't make it through the first time.
Well, that's quite normal on the first try.
No difficulty
Everything went as planned.
I didn't encounter any particular difficulties.
Well done you! On my first try, well, it took me three goes...
My first time, it took three goes before I finally made it.
But you did it...
Gregory? What can I do for you?
I've just come to make sure dear Louis has all the information he needs.
Needs for what?
You are free to make your own choices, William?
I would like the same for him too.
There's nothing I want more, Gregory.
Your schemes will lead you to your demise, Brother.
Preserve Louis. He has nothing to do with all this.
The end of the conference approaches and this masquerade will soon be torn asunder.
Don't drag him down with you in your disgrace.
Johann infected Louis with poison to eliminate him before the conference, Gregory.
I... No, he didn't...
You know what that means?
No, wait!
There must be an explanation!
In MY residence!
He attacked MY son!
And Johann is mine!!
If he made the unforgivable error of attacking Louis, I will personally take care of him!
He will be gone by this evening!
How do you feel?
I want my revenge!
I want him to pay!
I can assure you he will be punished, I'll be firm.
But I must do it alone... He's my son.
I refuse to put Johann at your mercy.
Alright... Louis, you can trust him, Johann will have to take responsibility for his action.
For the moment, not so bad
The poison hasn't taken effect yet.
I don't feel anything in particular.
Good.
I hope your metabolism will react against the poison.
I'm afraid
I don't believe this, I'm going to die...
Don't say that, nothing is less certain. You'll make it through, Louis!
If you didn't know Johann had poisoned Louis, what did you come for?
I came to persuade you to let him choose.
Ye of little faith!
On the contrary, Brother.
Louis has just entered the family.
Give him a chance to find his place.
His place?
Under Father's reign, we all know what it is in advance!
What do you mean?
What place is that?
At the end of a leash, like all the others.
Say nothing
Don't listen to him, he's angry with our Father.
And with good reason!
He governs us in the same way he governs humanity...
Through fear and submission!
Same old tune...
When will you understand that it's necessary to impose order for things to move forward properly?
You are under his thumb and proud of it! Open your eyes, for crying out loud!
His whole system has become outdated and he's too old to see it.
He will lead us to our demise!
Here he goes with another of his grand speeches...
William has always been fond of staging big scenes. It's his theatrical side.
You can say that again
Does he have an inferiority complex?
I've told him time and time again, Louis.
He always has to take it one step too far.
Don't reveal...
How dare y...
You are blind, Brother. Even if if the evidence bit you on the nose, you still wouldn't see it.
I feel sorry for you.
Tea is drunk hot or not at all, William! When will you learn?
It's too bitter!
You shouldn't let it infuse so long.
I knew you'd be coming along... You are so predictable.
Methodical, more like.
Things must be accomplished in the right order if we want the world to keep turning as it does.
And too bad for the consequences?
Whatever the consequences?
What do you mean?
Let's say it hardly leaves any room for free will, does it?
It's the adult's responsibility to provide education for their children, Louis.
Our family only ensures, through its experience, that Daemons do not lose themselves in rash decision-making
It resembles an autocratic regime.
When you speak of the “right order”, I can't help hearing “your order”.
Louis, don't you think that by now we have acquired a certain experience?
Don't you think that we are the best placed to know what the “right order” should be by now?
I mostly understand that even with the best of intentions, this kind of talk could well be misinterpreted.
Every powerful man has had to speak in this way at some stage.
That doesn't mean they were right or that they achieved great things.
Take the Kings of France, for example, they weren't all good monarchs.
But what's he afraid that Mortimer will do to me?
You came here to warn me, sir.
To advise you.
Advise me against my Father.
Why?
I think you are capable of deciding for...
You haven't answered my question.
Why warn me against my Father? What are you afraid he will do to me?
Well, I wouldn't want him to lead you into I-don't-know-what absurd adventure in which...
You act as though I were in danger...
I agree with Louis, Gregory. You are trying to pass me off as the villain about to devour poor Louis.
That's's not funny, William!
I won't let him follow you!
You see, Louis, Gregory came here to make you change your mind.
It's time for things to change. I acknowledge Father has done many good things for humanity...
But his time is over, and now he must pass on the torch.
That's enough!
There, Louis! That's the pathetic example your Father has to offer.
I really am sorry about what happened to you.
You don't know our family yet. We can't have given you a very good impression but bear in mind that we are all against William's project.
On the contrary!
If he insists on going through with it, we will have no other choice than to intervene by force.
Consequently, you're going to have chose sides, my dear boy. I would sincerely rather have met you in easier circumstances...
There you are, Louis.
See what happens when you don't follow their orders to the letter.
Louis, I'm afraid now is the time to decide.
If you follow William, he will drag you down with him.
If, on the other hand, you support me, I can assure you that nothing will happen to you.
You won't be mixed up in your father's errors.
The masks are off.
I offer you liberty. He obliges you to choose. And shamelessly asks you to betray your own father.
That is their true face...
Right, before I answer, I'd better think it over very carefully.
Do I intend to embrace my Daemon nature and take my place on the chess-board?
Do I stay out of it and do my utmost to stop them?
Or do I renounce my nature and do all I can to stay human?
I AM A DAEMON
It's useless trying to resist my true nature. I am a Daemon, may as well accept it, the sooner the better.
Even if I continue to live as a human, all my friends and acquaintances will inevitably end up dying... and I'll be left on my own, forever.
I am a Daemon and I have to behave like one, the sooner the better!
I AM A MAN
I was born a man, I... I grew up as such!
Finding out that I'm a Daemon makes no difference.
I refuse to let them manipulate humanity the way they do!
They're gonna ask me to choose between them, I'll just have to go with the lesser evil of the two.
But they'd better not count on me to keep my word... I'll bring them all down!
So?
What do you choose, Louis?
JOIN FORCES WITH MORTIMER
I shall follow my Father, Sir Gregory.
Very well. You can't say I didn't warn you.
Please don't take offense, but I just can't turn my back on him.
That said, if he turns his back on me, I won't be slow in sticking a dagger between his shoulder blades...
JOIN FORCES WITH HOLM
Father, I'm sorry but if I'm going to follow my instincts, I can't in good conscience follow you.
Wh... But...
I hope you won't take it personally...but I prefer to support Sir Gregory.
Very well! You have made your choice!
It's time we finished what we started, Brother!
The final vote of the conference over the acquisition of Louisiana will take place in a few hours.
I propose you gather your troops and prepare to close the debate.
That's what I was going to suggest.
Come, follow me.
It's time for us to get ready.
Monsieur de Richet, what can I do for you?
I was just passing by and wondered how you felt, monsieur.
Me?
Never felt better, my friend!
I can't wait for the conference to resume.
We absolutely must get Lord Mortimer's project voted in, Louis.
The idea of selling Louisiana is a stroke of genius.
Mortimer clearly doesn't do things by half measures...
The poor wretch doesn't seem to remember a thing...
But... what about what happened?...
What are you talking about, Louis? I don't understand.
No doubt about it, Lord Mortimer's receptions are truly sumptuous.
I could quite happily remain here forever. But, what can I say?
All good things must come to an end.
If I were you, I wouldn't stay a minute longer with Sir Gregory.
Join us, my friend, nothing is going to stop us from winning the vote.
We shall see...
Anyway, I shan't disturb you any further.
But you're not disturbing me in the slightest, Louis.
See you later.

But you're not disturbing me in the slightest, Louis.
See you later.
See you later, Louis.
Leave me, de Richet.
I want nothing more to do with you.
I shall have left within the hour and I wish never to see you again for the rest of my life.
I haven't the time, Louis...
I have to write my report for his holiness.
Normally, I would be delighted to chat with you, but this is not the right time, my child...
His holiness awaits my report.
Ah, well... Louis...
What brings you back to my chambers?
May I sit down?
Of course, Louis. Don't you feel very well?
Yes, but if I'm gonna pass inside you, I'd better sit myself down first.
It's nothing, don't worry about it.
Well, what can I do for you?
Right, now I need to concentrate.
I wanted to speak to you, your Eminence.
Speak to him about Daemons
Do you believe in Daemons?
What are you going on about, Louis?
Where is he going with this?
I can feel something...
Daemons, your Eminence!
I am a Cardinal, of course I believe in evil!
What on earth is the matter with him? Is he losing his mind or what?
Alright hang in there, Louis, don't lose him!
Rest assured, your Eminence, I'm fine...
I... But... it's impossi...
Rest assured, your Eminence, I am fine...
Speak to him about politics
What exactly is your role with regard to the Holy-Father?
I...What?
What on earth is he playing at?
It's coming!
You're a Cardinal in pectore... Why don't you admit it?
Impertinent little brat!
Louis, I don't find this conversation in very good taste!
Alright, it's coming!
Come on, Giuseppe, let me in...
WH...
Speak to him about the Holy Lance
I wanted to thank you for your help...
I mean, for your time talking to me about the Holy Lance.
Oh, and did you find it?
It's the crusade of a lifetime for some people, Louis... You are searching for another Holy Grail.
Nearly there... Link into his thoughts!
Does it annoy you at all?
But... What on earth is he trying to get at?
Why do you ask, Louis?
I don't follow...
For the glory, your Eminence...
I can feel it coming! It's working!
What insolence!
Why... Really! I am a man of the Church, Louis!
May God keep me from such ambitions.
Right... let me in, your Eminence...
Why, rea...
Speak to him about the conference
Your Eminence, I'd like to speak to you about the conference.
Sorry, my son, but I would rather not speak about it...
Damn it. Change subjects, Louis...
Quick!
Ah! Aahhh... I've done it!!
I've done it, damn it!!! He was right!!
This is just crazy... I can't believe it...
Look at yourself, Louis. You better not get caught!
Woah... I still need to get used to this body.
So... let's see about what Mortimer asked me.
Ah, well... Louis...
What brings you back to my chambers?
May I sit down?
Of course, Louis. Don't you feel very well?
Yes, but if I'm gonna pass inside you, I'd better sit myself down first.
It's nothing, don't worry about it.
Well, what can I do for you?
Right, now I need to concentrate.
I wanted to speak to you, your Eminence.

Do you believe in Daemons?

Where is he going with this?

Why, rea...
Speak to him about the conference
Your Eminence, I'd like to speak to you about the conference.
Sorry, my son, but I would rather not speak about it...
Damn it. Change subjects, Louis...
Quick!
Ah! Aahhh... I've done it!!
I've done it, damn it!!! He was right!!
This is just crazy... I can't believe it...
Look at yourself, Louis. You better not get caught!
Woah... I still need to get used to this body.
So... let's see about what Mortimer asked me.
Sir, I am sorry but I cannot let you enter.
I am sorry, sir, but access to this room is not authorized by my master.
Louis... Busy as always, I see?
How lucky you are... I must admit I'm trying to kill the boredom myself...
That's the least you can say...
I get the impression we're all in the same boat...
And here I was thinking you might have some juicy gossip...
And yourself, anything to tell?
Me? No, nothing at all... And you?
I would like to be able to say yes, but it's been dead quiet...
The only one with anything to say is Duke Manuel, but with that accent of his, I don't understand a word he says. It's exasperating...
Right, I've wasted enough time!
I'll keep our conversation to myself, Mr President. Anyway, I must be going now.
See you later, Louis.
No, alas...
I wish I could entertain you, but apart from recommending a few paintings, I don't know what to suggest...
That's very kind of you but I'm quite sick of gazing at all those modern paintings!
Thank you all the same...
A last guest is expected
Well, mister Godoy heard that we are expecting a last minute guest...
Pardon?
Yes, a certain Al Azif.
Hmm... Strange... Doesn't ring a bell...
Might as well not hang out here any longer if he has nothing to say...
Me neither...
He must have misunderstood, the conference has started...
Godoy is a little too used to court intrigue if you ask me...
I agree with you...
Well, nevertheless, I hope I have distracted you a little.
Yes, thank you, Louis, I don't need much!
And don't hesitate if you ever do have any news.
I won't, Mr President.
I haven't the time
I'm sorry, Mr President, but I don't have a minute to spare right now and...
Yes, I see, I see...
No time for a chitchat with an elder, of course...
Well, run along, my young friend!
Louis... Busy as always I see?
How lucky you are... I must admit I'm trying to kill the boredom myself...
That's the least you can say...
I get the impression we're all in the same boat...
There was me thinking you might have some hot gossip...
And yourself, anything to tell?
No, nothing... And you?
I would like to have been able to say yes but it's been dead quiet...
The only one with anything to say for himself is Duke Manuel but I don't understand a word he says with his accent, it's exasperating...
Right, I've wasted enough time!
I'll keep silent about your feelings, Mr President. Anyway, I'll be getting along now.
See you later, Louis.
No, alas...
I wish I could entertain you but apart from recommending a few paintings, I'm lost for what to suggest...
That's very kind of you but I'm quite sick of gazing at all those modern paintings!
Thank you all the same...
A last guest is expected
Monsieur Godoy heard that we are expecting a last minute guest...
Pardon?
Yes, a certain Al Azif?
Hmm... Strange... Doesn't ring a bell...
Moght as well not say any more if he has nothing interesting to say...
Me neither...
He must have misunderstood, the conference has started...
Godoy is too used to court intrigue if you ask me...
I agree with you...
Well, nevertheless I hope I have entertained you a little?
Yes, thank you, Louis, I don't need much!
And don't hesitate if you have any news?
I won't, Mr President.
I haven't the time
I'm sorry, Mr President, but I don't have a minute to spare right now and...
Yes, I see, I see...
No time for a chitchat with an elder, of course...
Well, run along, my young friend!
Please don't hold it against me but I would like to be alone for a while.
Your Eminence, all ready to send the...
What's he doing here?
Damn it! That's all I need...
Don't worry... He can't hear us...
What do you mean "he can't hear us"?
What's going on here, Piaggi?
MINDREADER
The old goat is going to drop us! The lousy turncoat!
He'd better not tell me he just fell asleep!
Say that you have exorcised Louis
Just calm down, calm down.
Louis came to see me because he claimed he was hearing voices.
We've just finished an exorcism session.
An exorcism?...
Are you having me on? I can't see any exorcism instruments!
That's because I've just put them away...
I don't know what you're up to, Piaggi, but I do know you're trying to pull one over on me...
Tell him you gave Louis a tranquilizer
Calm down, now.
Monsieur de Richet came to see me because he was having anxiety attacks and wanted something to help him relax.
I'm afraid I've been a little heavy handed.
You can say that again!
Say Louis is tired
I don't know what to say...
He was already here when I entered my room.
I presumed he must be tired.
Tired?...
Are you having me on, Piaggi, or what?
What, I wouldn't dare.
I don't know what you're trying to pull but I really don't like it!
Tell him Louis has has passed out
Calm down, my friend.
The poor boy has just passed out.
We were talking about this and that when suddenly he fainted, keeled over, just like that.
Huh, really, what a weakling!
I wonder what Mortimer sees in him.
Who knows...
I was about to fetch someone to take care of him.
Would you care to go...
There he is and there he stays! The perfect opportunity!
What do you mean?
It's been a while now that I've been hoping for a chance to get rid of him.
I... no... Listen, my son, this is all getting out of hand.
Hogwash! I don't trust him in the slightest!
Why not?
No... I... But why the devil do you want to get rid of him?
Can you keep a secret?
Of course
Of course, my son.
Would you like to tell me under the confidentiality of confession?
Ach, don't talk rubbish!
I don't trust the little runt because he is Mortimer's son, would you believe it!
How does he know?
Dear God, how is that possible?
I am flabbergasted...
I'd rather not know
No, I don't think I'd like to know about anything that would justify such an act...
I don't know what's wrong with you but you really must pull yourself together!
The conference will soon be on us and I don't need you falling to pieces now!
Don't worry, I shall be there.
We've wasted enough time, what if he wakes up!
If you don't want to get your hands dirty, just turn away and leave everything to me!
This is not a decision to be taken lightly.
You're defending him now?
What are you talking about? Of course not.
He's made you change sides, hasn't he?
MINDREADER
The slime bag...he works for Mortimer!
Good thing I already tried to warn Gregory!
Of course not.
You find Louis unconscious and conclude that I'm his accomplice?
It's not so much finding him here as you being against me getting rid of him...
That's not what you thought the day before yesterday after he eavesdropped on our conversation!
That's right, he's made me change sides!
Even if I confess his arguments hit home...
So that's it!
You don't even bother to hide it!
What's the connection between my vote and his life?
I knew you would end up changing sides!
Holm will be against it
I am certain that Sir Gregory would be opposed.
You know nothing!
I know Sir Gregory better than...
That's against the rules of the conference, Monsieur von Wöllner!
I refuse to go against Sir Gregory.
Right...
Not in my room!
Committing a crime in my room is out of the question!
Think, it will all be on our heads, no doubt about it!
I...
I refuse to run the risk!
Right...
You are going too far!
I refuse to get involved! That's against the rules, for heaven's sake!
The rules?
The consequences of the conference could well destabilize the world order. It's our duty to shelve Mortimer's project.
And to accomplish that, anything goes!
Monsieur von Wöllner, I always act in the best interest of all.
I assure you!
Everyone's entitled to an opinion...
You must have lost your mind to want to take such an extreme course of action!
No one's asking you to help me do it.
MINDREADER
He is capable of reporting me to Sir Gregory!
I'm really risking my neck here...
I'll tell Holm everything!
If you lay a finger on him I'll denounce you to Sir Gregory! I'm warning you!
You old weasel!
I will report it to your King
If you commit a murder, I will report you directly to King Frederick!
I fear nothing, imbecile! The King is my friend!
He will never believe you!
I will tell Mortimer!
I'm warning you, if you continue, I will inform Lord Mortimer!
I'm not afraid of Mortimer! It's Sir Gregory I serve!
You run the risk getting the conference canceled!
You can't attack him without running the risk of jeopardizing the conference!
Even though Sir Gregory has the edge?
No... Gregory will never forgive you.
Good Outcome
Very well, Piaggi, you win!
I refuse to let you do the first thing that comes into your head.
I don't know what the two of you are up to, but I'll find out sooner or later.
Right, time for me to get back into my body.
Right, don't just stand there, Louis. Mortimer's waiting for you in the red salon!
Bad Outcome
Listen carefully, Piaggi! If you say anything, you'll be the one they find dead in your bed!
Now, just turn around and let me handle this!
Success
Don't touch him!
Out of my room!
You'll pay for this, Piaggi! This is not over!
default
Stop!
Now, if you don't want to end up the same way, you will do as you are told and vote what we tell you!
Is that understood?
I forbid you...
Wöllner!!...
No! He's infected my body with whatever's in that syringe!...
He's poisoned me!!...
Get out, Louis! No one must find you here!
Your Eminence, all ready to send the...
What's he doing here?
Damn it! That's all I need...
Don't worry... He can't hear us...
What do you mean "he can't hear us"?
What's going on here, Piaggi?
MINDREADER
The old goat is going to drop us! The lousy turncoat!
He'd better not tell me he just fell asleep!
Say that you have exorcised Louis
Just calm down, calm down.
Louis came to see me because he claimed he was hearing voices.
We've just finished an exorcism session.
An exorcism?...
Are you having me on? I can't see any exorcism instruments!
That's because I've just put them away...
I don't know what you're up to, Piaggi, but I do know you're trying to pull one over on me...
Tell him you gave Louis a tranquilizer
Calm down, now.
Monsieur de Richet came to see me because he was having anxiety attacks and wanted something to help him relax.
I'm afraid I've been a little heavy handed.
You can say that again!
Say Louis is tired
I don't know what to say...
He was already here when I entered my room.
I presumed he must be tired.
Tired?...
Are you having me on, Piaggi, or what?
What, I wouldn't dare.
I don't know what you're trying to pull but I really don't like it!
Tell him Louis has has passed out
Calm down, my friend.
The poor boy has just passed out.
We were talking about this and that when suddenly he fainted, keeled over, just like that.
Huh, really, what a weakling!
I wonder what Mortimer sees in him.
Who knows...
I was about to fetch someone to take care of him.
Would you care to go...
There he is and there he stays! The perfect opportunity!
What do you mean?
It's been a while now that I've been hoping for a chance to get rid of him.
I... no... Listen, my son, this is all getting out of hand.
Hogwash! I don't trust him in the slightest!
Why not?
No... I... But why the devil do you want to get rid of him?
Can you keep a secret?
Of course
Of course, my son.
Would you like to tell me under the confidentiality of confession?
Ach, don't talk rubbish!
I don't trust the little runt because he is Mortimer's son, would you believe it!
How does he know?
Dear God, how is that possible?
I am flabbergasted...
I'd rather not know
No, I don't think I'd like to know about anything that would justify such an act...
I don't know what's wrong with you but you really must pull yourself together!
The conference will soon be on us and I don't need you falling to pieces now!
Don't worry, I shall be there.
We've wasted enough time, what if he wakes up!
If you don't want to get your hands dirty, just turn away and leave everything to me!
This is not a decision to be taken lightly.
You're defending him now?
What are you talking about? Of course not.
He's made you change sides, hasn't he?
MINDREADER
The slime bag...he works for Mortimer!
Good thing I already tried to warn Gregory!
Of course not.
You find Louis unconscious and conclude that I'm his accomplice?
It's not so much finding him here as you being against me getting rid of him...
That's not what you thought the day before yesterday after he eavesdropped on our conversation!
That's right, he's made me change sides!
Even if I confess his arguments hit home...
So that's it!
You don't even bother to hide it!
What's the connection between my vote and his life?
I knew you would end up changing sides!
Holm will be against it
I am certain that Sir Gregory would be opposed.
You know nothing!
I know Sir Gregory better than...
That's against the rules of the conference, Monsieur von Wöllner!
I refuse to go against Sir Gregory.
Right...
Not in my room!
Committing a crime in my room is out of the question!
Think, it will all be on our heads, no doubt about it!
I...
I refuse to run the risk!
Right...
You are going too far!
I refuse to get involved! That's against the rules, for heaven's sake!
The rules?
The consequences of the conference could well destabilize the world order. It's our duty to shelve Mortimer's project.
And to accomplish that, anything goes!
Monsieur von Wöllner, I always act in the best interest of all.
I assure you!
Everyone's entitled to an opinion...
You must have lost your mind to want to take such an extreme course of action!
No one's asking you to help me do it.
MINDREADER
He is capable of reporting me to Sir Gregory!
I'm really risking my neck here...
I'll tell Holm everything!
If you lay a finger on him I'll denounce you to Sir Gregory! I'm warning you!
You old weasel!
I will report it to your King
If you commit a murder, I will report you directly to King Frederick!
I fear nothing, imbecile! The King is my friend!
He will never believe you!
I will tell Mortimer!
I'm warning you, if you continue, I will inform Lord Mortimer!
I'm not afraid of Mortimer! It's Sir Gregory I serve!
You run the risk getting the conference canceled!
You can't attack him without running the risk of jeopardizing the conference!
Even though Sir Gregory has the edge?
No... Gregory will never forgive you.
Good Outcome
Very well, Piaggi, you win!
I refuse to let you do the first thing that comes into your head.
I don't know what the two of you are up to, but I'll find out sooner or later.
Right, time for me to get back into my body.
Right, don't just stand there, Louis. Mortimer's waiting for you in the red salon!
Bad Outcome
Listen carefully, Piaggi! If you say anything, you'll be the one they find dead in your bed!
Now, just turn around and let me handle this!
Success
Don't touch him!
You could have killed me!
Out of my room!
You'll pay for this, Piaggi! This is not over!
Come on, Louis! Concentrate!
I did it!
Don't just stand there! Get out and go see Mortimer!
default
Stop!
Now, if you don't want to end up the same way, you will do as you are told and vote what we tell you!
Is that understood?
I forbid you...
Wöllner!!...
No! He's infected my body with whatever's in that syringe!...
He's poisoned me!!...
Get out, Louis! No one must find you here!
