After a discussion with Monsieur de Richet, last night, I've decided that Spain will join the coalition against France and will go to war as soon as I get back!
I am a man of conviction and of honor! And the way that Monsieur de Richet came to me to manipulate me into joining your side, Lord Mortimer, is unacceptable!
Furthermore, I refuse categorically your project about Louisiana!
You reap what you sow, William...
I do not believe that Monsieur de Richet meant to upset you but you have every right to react in this way.
What do you mean, Duke Manuel?
Sir Gregory, I regret to inform you that Spain will not support you in this operation.
I vote FOR!
Moreover, in response to arguments brought to my attention, I declare war on France!
What?? What is he doing?
If you think France is afraid of you, you are dreaming!
Over ten nations rise against you, young man, and you behave like a yapping little dog?
When the French armies are at your door, my Lord Duke, you will change your tune!
Well, as for me, I am FOR Lord Mortimer's project.
Despite Duchess Hillsborrow's overwhelmingly convincing nocturnal attentions.
What?! So, Emily was playing at trying to win over guests last night?
It was nothing more than a friendly little chat, of course.
How could it be otherwise ?
And by the way, remember me to your husband when you see him.
And you, President Washington, what is your position?
FOR, of course.
FOR, of course.
And I will add for your benefit, Sir Gregory, that next time you send someone to try to persuade me to change sides, choose someone with a minimum of experience.
Oh, I won't forget, Mr President.
Well, you see, Monsieur Bonaparte, I would rather you'd have forgotten me for a minute.
William, I am sorry but I cannot follow you this time.
George ?! What...?
I am AGAINST, William. Please excuse me.
I cannot commit the United States to such an enterprise. It's just too risky.
Well, that leaves just yourself and Monsieur PÃ©ru, Louis.
You're all making me sick!
Look at yourselves!
What?
You are pathetic!
Have you been drinking or what?
There you are quibbling away, "My Lord Duke" this and "Madame Duchess" that...
You know very well that we're nothing but puppets on a damned string!
Jacques, really!...
Let's end the charade! It's over!
Jacques...
My Lord...
Thank you for everything you've done for me over the years.
But it didn't come for free, and now I see the price is too high to pay.
I'll stop...
Come, Jacques, we'll talk it over.
No, I'm finished. I want my freedom back, my Lord. I shall no longer work for you.
INTERVENE
DON'T INTERVENE
I've had enough of your money, your influence, your power!
I want my freedom back! I want my damn life back!
My friends, the conference is about to begin.
Please excuse me if I troubled you last night with my project.
I understand that you might well have a few questions to ask.
As you know, the final vote will be cast in a few days. This morning's aim is to answer your questions and check the temperature of your respective positions, so that we may reach a greater understanding.
As always, Lord Mortimer.
We parted in perfect disagreement, my Lord.
Where would you like us to take it from?
Come, sir, please let William believe he still has a chance of winning us over.  Otherwise his imprecations will lack panache and we shall be bored stiff.
Oh, let me reassure you, I am convinced that a good night's sleep has brought sound advice, and that this morning will be even more interesting.
Therefore, I would like to go round the table in order to hear everyone's first impressions.
Well, I am still firmly AGAINST it. Even though my choice won't count.
AGAINST
AGAINST
AGAINST
And you, Duke Manuel?
AGAINST, of course!
Well, you see... it is more complicated than... it...er...
Godoy!
Come, Gregory, don't try to impress my guests, please.
They are not YOUR guests!
Gregory!
Anyone under my roof is, by definition, MY guest.
You included.
I would be very grateful if you would let MY guests speak. Duke Manuel, you were saying you still had some doubts?
Well, you see, the situation has changed since last night.
What's going on here, my Lord Duke?
You see, I gave it some thought during the night. New arguments have come to light.
