That leaves little time for the...  little favor I spoke to you about.
Indeed, I'll go straight away.
Leave them to talk
I shall be leaving you.
"Dear Monsieur Bonaparte,
in reply to your demand of enthronement into our society... 
... and hereby inform you that, unfortunately, you do not meet the criteria required to become a member of the Golden Order.
We are however honored by the interest you have shown in our research and activities.
We have no doubt that your keen interest for the occult sciences will one day allow you to join us... 
and in anticipation of that day, please accept the expression of our full consideration.

"Le souper de Beaucaire"
It hasn't been signed yet but there's a letter with it...
Read the letter
Examine the writing
It isn't signed. That's some quality paper...  And that handwriting...
I'd say it's Mortimer's.
Put back the letter on the manuscript

"My dear Bonaparte,
As promised here are the few pages that I recommend you publish within the next few months.
We both know that it's shear lack of time that prented you from stringing these lines together yourself.
The ideas are yours, though.
No need to feel indebted, your success will suffice for the good of all."

Well, that's one thing out of the way!
Only thing left to do is wait for the conference to resume tomorrow morning.
Shit, what a failure!
There is nothing more I can do except wait for the conference to resume tomorrow morning.

Leave me alone.
I asked you to leave me alone.
Wait!
De Richet...
You just can't help it, can you! Stop trying to play the hero, man!
He doesn't deserve that
Monsieur, I know I don't really know you, but you seem like a decent person.
I have done so many horrible things...
You blame yourself. I can see that. Everything's not lost.
I don't want to do bad things anymore...
You can take control of yourself again. You can fix whatever it is you've done.
Do you really believe that?
Of course, Jacques. You'll have all the time you need.
Make him think of his child!
Jacques, don't do it.
You're a father, you owe it to...
You bastard!
I'm going to help him
Jacques, you know you can count on me.
Calm down, please, I'm going to help you.
There's nothing you can do for me.
It's not like him
Jacques, calm down, you... you're frightening everyone.
Look at yourself, this is not the real you, come on.
Rest assured, my friends. You're in no danger from me.
He's not going to kill anyone
Jacques, everyone's getting a little heated, so let's take it easy a moment.
You're not going to kill anyone. You're going to calmly put away your...
It's going to be alright
I'm sure we can work things out.
But you don't know him...
Let's stay united, Jacques.
He's nothing without us.
Really?...
Trust me.
Holm can protect him
I've got an idea. If you are so afraid of Lord Mortimer's reaction, what if you joined sides with Sir Gregory?
Wake up, Louis... Holm or Mortimer, it's the same thing...
The Order can protect him
I'm sure we can find a solution.
The Golden Order can look after you, for example.
My boy, you just don't understand...
