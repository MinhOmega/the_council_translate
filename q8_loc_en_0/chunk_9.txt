What do you mean?... You don't understand, I wasn't threatening you at all!
Lord Mortimer wrote to me
I received a letter from Lord Mortimer inviting me...
THAT'S ENOUGH!
You want to corrupt us all... One after the other...
But you will never get me!
I am here to save her
I'm here to help you.
You have nothing to fear.
If only it were so simple...
Remind her about the quest of the Book
Remember Al Azif?
I was sure...
Where is the book, Mother?
So that's what you want... Well you will never find it.
Emily died for that !
What's got into her?
It's time to go home, Mother.
Let's go, Mother...  Let's go home.
In all my heart, there's nothing I want more...
But I know you won't let me leave...
You are evil incarnate.
Every word that comes out of your...  mouth...  is sharper than a razor blade.
I don't wish you any harm, really, mother!
It's me...  Louis!
DON'T SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HIM!!
YOU WILL NEVER GET HIM!!
Mother, stop torturing yourself.
It really is me, Louis. How can I convince you?
If you really are who you say you are, what was the saying I taught you?
You've been telling it to me since I was three years old, Mother. How can I ever forget it?
Always keep your mind rational...
And open
Open
And open
Right, well...  and open
... and open
You knew it...  You are smart...
You're getting me muddled up! Tell me rather...
Whose place were we at when I told you I was coming here?
Mother, I really am your son. You can't trick me!
We were in Paris, we were investigating an art dealer.
His name?
Von Bolchet
His name was... von... von Bolchet!
Louis would never have got it wrong, dirtbag!
Von Botcher
His name was von... Botcher.
You just made your first mistake, scumbag!
Von Morchert
His name was von... von Morchert.
Wrong!
Von Bolcher
I think he was called von Bolcher.
You think so?... Wrong.
Louis would never have gotten it wrong.
Von Borchert
I just told you, you can't trick me.
His name was von Borchert.
No no, wait, it's... it's just a detail... he...
He lived in Paris, near the Note-Dame Cathedral. We investigated him for three months.
He made a fortune by taking advantage of gullible collectors of Parisian high society.
You're a good actor...
He was an ancient art dealer.
He had the BOOK!! AL Azif!!
And that's what you wanted to get out of me, wasn't it?...
Not at all!
We unmasked him but then he came after us.
We escaped but you didn't want me to intervene.
That's how I got this scar.
I listened to you and we knocked him out.
What...  how?... You can't know about that...
L... Louis, No... I... Is it... Is it really you?...
My God, everything is lost then...
I refuse to believe it's really you, Louis.
Otherwise...  all this would be for nothing.
Mother, I... I don't know what happened to you, but don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
I'm here for you and...
No!... I ordered you not to come with me!
I received a letter and...
Lord Mortimer informed me of your disappearance.
So I took the...
No, no, NO!
... it's not true, it's a nightmare...  don't tell me that...
Have you spoken to him?
Oh shit...  she's completely panicked because I spoke to Mortimer.
It seems she's afraid of what he might have said to me about her...
DID HE SPEAK TO YOU?
Of course.
Naturally. Even though I had to wait three days for him to see me, we met only this morning.
You've been here for the past three days?...
Yes, why?
Is she afraid of what he might have said about Adams?
Mother, I don't know what you're imaging.
But don't worry, everything will be alright.
If you're worried about what I might think about Elizabeth Adams, honestly...
Oh Louis, Elizabeth is the last of my worries right now!
I did what I could for her but it was too late.
He wasn't here when I arrived.
Don't believe it! I... I thought I'd meet him the moment I arrived, given the situation.
