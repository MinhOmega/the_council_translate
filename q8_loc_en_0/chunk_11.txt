You will go to this conference and, from the inside, you'll do everything you can to prevent Mortimer's plan from going ahead smoothly.
We can talk later. I'll explain everything.
But why?
Do as I say, Louis! It's of the utmost importance! Beware of Mortimer. He won't let anything stand in his way.
You promise me that after...
Yes, after!
Go now.
Yes, Mother, I'm going, I'm going...
BAD OUTCOME
If you really are who you say you are, then you'll do what I ask of you!
Which is?
A conference is going to be held.
You will attend on my behalf.
No, wait, Mother...  No one cares about...
Shut up, Louis!
You will be invited and you will go.
Mortimer will present a project. Whatever this project is...
But...
WHATEVER THE PROJECT IS, I want you to learn as much as you can about it.
You'll have to get by as best you can, but we must find out what it's about.
Do you understand?
Don't you think that before all that, there are a few issues to be addressed?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
Yeess, alright, alright, I understand!
I'll explain afterward!
But right now, you MUST go to the conference.
Go now.
You do realize you're still treating me like a...
Go!
If you aren't there when I get back, I warn you...
One more thing, Mother...
Emily Hillsborrow, Emma's sister, came to this island looking for her sister...
She probably won't hesitate to take revenge and...
It's the signal that the conference is starting, Louis.
Don't be concerned about the Duchess, she's the last of our worries.
Don't move...
Wait, I don't...
So, you've come at last.
Easy...
Let me turn around...
Oh my God, Mother, what has happened to you?
Who are you?
What? But...  Mother...
Who...  ARE YOU?
It's me! Louis...  your son.
No, you lie!
You won't catch me out like that...  Louis...  Louis isn't here.
He obeys his mother...  He would never have come here.
Mother, I don't know what you've been through, but...
...lower your arm...
Please.
You think I was born yesterday, do you?
But it won't work!
I'm begging you...
One day, you will fall...
Mother...
Why are you here?
I'm here for her.
I came for you.
Oh, I don't doubt that for a second. But you will never get me!
What do you mean?... You don't understand, I wasn't threatening you at all!
Lord Mortimer wrote to me
I received a letter from Lord Mortimer inviting me...
THAT'S ENOUGH!
You want to corrupt us all... One after the other...
But you will never get me!
I am here to save her
I'm here to help you.
You have nothing to fear.
If only it were so simple...
Remind her about the quest of the Book
Remember Al Azif?
I was sure...
Where is the book, Mother?
So that's what you want... Well you will never find it.
Emily died for that !
What's got into her?
It's time to go home, Mother.
Let's go, Mother...  Let's go home.
In all my heart, there's nothing I want more...
But I know you won't let me leave...
You are evil incarnate.
Every word that comes out of your...  mouth...  is sharper than a razor blade.
I don't wish you any harm, really, mother!
It's me...  Louis!
DON'T SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HIM!!
YOU WILL NEVER GET HIM!!
Mother, stop torturing yourself.
It really is me, Louis. How can I convince you?
If you really are who you say you are, what was the saying I taught you?
You've been telling it to me since I was three years old, Mother. How can I ever forget it?
Always keep your mind logical...
And open
Open
And open
Right, well...  and open
... and open
You knew it...  You are smart...
You're getting me muddled up! Tell me rather...
Whose place were we at when I told you I was coming here?
