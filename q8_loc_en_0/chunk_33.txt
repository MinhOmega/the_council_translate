"Thus ends the Great Work.
The incarnation of the purified spirit, the elevation of the soul now become perfect, its resurrection thanks to the action of the Alchemist."
Except if the Alchemist has bad intentions, then it's called manipulation...
I've had enough...
Very metaphorical, as occult theories go...
The human spirit being the Prima Materia of the Alchemist.
"Dear Johann,
I am so glad you are coming. I did not doubt for a single minute that you would accept this invitation... 
... despite the risks involved and the fact that we know each other well.
Though we have gotten over many obstacles together, I cannot hide my apprehension this time round.
Given how high stakes are today.
But having you here, Johann, is an invaluable asset!
Keep up the effort, and I will be all the more proud and satisfied.
I look forward to seeing you again... 
Gregory H.

Ah, Monsieur de Richet! You wouldn't have seen Duke Manuel by any chance, would you?
Yes, in the dining-room
I... I just ran into him. He was heading for the dining-room.
Ah!  Thank you...
No
No, I'm sorry. I don't know where he is.
Very well, I shall wait for him in that case.
I was going to ask you the same question...
I wanted to speak to him but no one will open the door. I'm not sure he's in there.
If I want to pass through, I'll have to get Wöllner out of the way...
Have you tried entering?
Perhaps he didn't hear you. Did you try entering?
No, of course not...  It would not be proper, after all!
Make him leave
Oh, now wait a minute! Yes,  I remember now...  I think I saw him in the garden!
In the garden? No, you must be mistaken, I've just come from there. I would have seen him...
Oh...  I must have been someone else then...
Most certainly.  Oh well, he's bound to turn up at some point. I'll wait.
Impossible to get through with him glued in front of the door...  I'll have to find another way into Godoy's room.
Make up a story to get through
Excuse me but I must fetch a letter for the Duke.
Very well, sir. You may pass.
Make him search somewhere else.
I've searched all over the manor, but I can't find him.
One thing's for sure, Monsieur de Richet, he's neither in his room nor on this floor. I've just looked all over...
I propose we both look for him. The first to find him tells the Duke that the other is also looking for him. Agreed?
Perfect, let's do that! I shall have a look in the library!
If you find the Duke before me, tell him I want to speak to him.
Yes, let's proceed as you say...
Thank you, Monsieur de Richet.
Right, now be a good boy and go look somewhere else...
Force your way through
Excuse me, Monsieur von Wöllner, I'd like to get past...
Sorry, sir, but you will have to wait your turn!  I, too, would like to speak to the Duke...
Great...  now he's not gonna let me pass.
Move away
He won't let me by...  I'll have to find another way of getting into the damn room!!
Let's think... Come on! So...  apart from the door...  the only other way is by the balcony...
Ah, Monsieur de Richet! You wouldn't have seen Duke Manuel by any chance, would you?
Yes, in the dining-room
