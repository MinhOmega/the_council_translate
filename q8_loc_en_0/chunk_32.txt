No, don't go imaging such things, Louis, really.
Unfortunately not.
I'm making progress.
I'm making progress but she seems to keep moving from one hideout to another.
Time is short, unfortunately. The conference is about to begin. Sarah was supposed to be here.
Her seat must not remain vacant. Could you replace her, just until we've found her?
That's not what I came here for.
I understand but something important is going to happen during the conference... 
Your mother and I were supposed to back Mortimer's project. I don't know the exact subject but the future of our countries is at stake.
Don't worry, when Sarah turns up, she'll take her seat.
When my mother turns up again, first and foremost she'll go away to get some medical care... 
He can count on me
You can count on me, Mr President.
As long as my mother is unable to be present herself, I shall voice her opinions... 
Thank you, Louis. I knew I could count on you.
Don't commit yourself to anything
Look, I'm willing to follow you, however, I must warn you, I am not up familiar with the agenda.
I can therefore make no promises as to my position. 
I shall decide accordingly when the time comes.
Very well, I understand.
I only hope you don't put your mother in a delicate situation.
Come, we are expected.
Louis, I've been looking for you.
Have you managed to find your mother?
No, don't go imaging such things, Louis, really.
Unfortunately not.
I'm making progress.

"Dear Mr President,"
I am returning my answer as quickly as I can... 
We already spoke about it before you left, but I note that things have not improved... 
I urge you to follow my advice and to stop taking Laudanum immediately!
I am already looking for a substitute, but I am afraid you won't wait.
Your excessive consummation is in danger of definitively impairing your chances of securing your next mandate.
Your addiction is jeopardizing the exercise of your office and duties, my friend.
I regret I see no other solution but to stop your daily intake.
Yours sincerely,
Dr W.Thomton"

"The Great Work of the Soul" by S. Madone
"Pure alchemy is a thought, an art that is performed on the matter of the soul... "
"Great Alchemists work to transform and perfect the latter by a series of processes known as the Great Work."
"There are four phases to attain the ultimate in spiritual fulfillment.."
“Melanosis”
"The human soul must descend, be corrupt in order to become decomposed."
It's something like what I felt when I think of what I found out about my mother...
“Leukosis”
"The soul broken up must be purified by the Alchemist."
Nice program...
“Xanthosis”
"The soul must be transformed in order to attain sublimation by the recombination of the Alchemist."
It's tempting.
“Iosis”
"Thus ends the Great Work.
The incarnation of the purified spirit, the elevation of the soul now become perfect, its resurrection thanks to the action of the Alchemist."
Except if the Alchemist has bad intentions, then it's called manipulation...
I've had enough...
Very metaphorical, as occult theories go...
The human spirit being the Prima Materia of the Alchemist.
