Oh, I won't forget, Mr President.
Well, you see, Monsieur Bonaparte, I would rather you'd have forgotten me for a minute.
William, I'm sorry, but I can't be on your side on this one.
George ?! What...?
I am AGAINST, William. Please excuse me.
I cannot commit the United States to such an enterprise. It's just too risky.
Well, that leaves just yourself and Monsieur PÃ©ru, Louis.
You're all making me sick!
Look at yourselves!
What?
You are pathetic!
Have you been drinking or what?
There you are quibbling away, "My Lord Duke" this and "Madame Duchess" that...
You know very well that we're nothing but puppets on a damned string!
Jacques, really!...
Let's end the charade! It's over!
Jacques...
My Lord...
Thank you for everything you've done for me over the years.
But it didn't come for free, and now I see the price is too high to pay.
I'll stop...
Come, Jacques, we'll talk it over.
No, I'm finished. I want my freedom back, my Lord. I shall no longer work for you.
INTERVENE
DON'T INTERVENE
I've had enough of your money, your influence, your power!
I want my freedom back! I want my damn life back!
An old blanket.
Judging from the state of it, couldn't have kept her very warm.

Someone's made a fire here: the ashes are still warm.
If you're the one who did it, mother, it couldn't have been easy with only one hand!
The ashes... 
I must have just missed her.
If only I hadn't wasted so much time getting out of Lord Mortimer's study.
Leave it.

Food leftovers... 
Not exactly fresh; must have been here a while...

He's dead...
What the hell has been going on here?
Examine the body
Somebody smashed him in the back of the head with something.
He slowly bled to death...
But that isn't what killed him...  They broke his neck.
Search
Look under the mask
Let's see what secret's hidden under these masks...
His face doesn't ring a bell. I'm a bit disappointed.
I'd have expected more from Lord Mortimer!
Move away
Mother, if this is your doing, the situation is getting worse and worse!

Don't move...
Wait, I don't...
So, you've come at last.
Easy...
Let me turn around...
Oh my God, Mother, what has happened to you?
Who are you?
What? But...  Mother...
Who...  ARE YOU?
It's me! Louis...  your son.
No, you lie!
You won't catch me out like that...  Louis...  Louis isn't here.
He obeys his mother...  He would never have come here.
Mother, I don't know what you've been through, but...
...lower your arm...
Please.
You think I was born yesterday, do you?
But it won't work!
I'm begging you...
One day, you will fall...
Mother...
Why are you here?
I'm here for her.
I came for you.
Oh, I don't doubt that for a second. But you will never get me!
