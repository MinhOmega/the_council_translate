Monsieur, I'm astounded. I did not think you capable but you've succeeded.
I will be more wary of you the next time.
Nonetheless, if you can guarantee Lord Mortimer's support, then, yes, you can count on my vote when the time comes.
However, I expect you to be discreet with regard to my former partners, without which our agreement will become null and void.
Of course, my Lord Duke. You can count on me.
Lord Mortimer will be delighted to hear the news.
I hope you know what you're getting into, Louis.
I bid you good luck.
Good night, my Lord Duke.
See you tomorrow.
BAD OUTCOME  - GODOY SAYS HE WILL NOT VOTE FOR HOLM
How could you ever think a pup like you could manipulate me in this way, for a single second?
Never will I follow you!
Let me tell you that not only do I refuse any collusion with you but I will go much further...
I declare war on you, Monsieur de Richet! On you, on your family! On your country!
I will give you war like you've never seen before!
Now get out of here!
Well, well, I hope Mortimer knows what he's doing, because he's going to get his bloody war.
Manuel, I am very surprised by your response.
Shit, it's worse than before...
My Lord Duke, there must be a misunderstanding. Come now, there's no need for anything like that.
I am convinced that...
GET OUT OF HERE!
Marie Louise of Parma.
How ironic having a painting of the Queen of Spain in one's room, my Lord Duke.
Notice something.
Mmmm...  It looks like someone's hidden something on the back of this painting.
It's a letter.
Of course, it's written in Spanish. And it reeks of lavender.
Well, well. Monsieur Godoy, you seem very interested in hiding this letter. Another secret romance I presume ?
Observe the painting.
Ah, looks like someone's slipped something in the back here.
It's a letter. Let's see what it says.
It reeks of perfume and it's written in Spanish.
Godoy, you really are a little devil... 
Translate the letter
So, let's see what it says.
Leave

Now leave me!
Please leave me, sir, from now on no one must see us together.
"My tender Pepita...  I feel so guilty at being so far away from you again, even if it's for the good of my country.
I feel awful at having to leave you after a silly little spat, because you are the only woman I love, Josepha, forever... 
I told you before: everything I have, everything I can offer you, I owe to the affection of the Queen.
Let's stay united, please, even in sacrifice, for the two of us, for our future children!
Stop being jealous: you are the only one who fills my thoughts, everything else is just a game, I swear... "

It seems the Queen isn't the only one enjoying the Lord Duke's favors... 
If the Queen found out, it would cost him dearly.
I'll keep it with me, you never know.

Good evening, Monsieur le fran√ßais...
Duchess...
You here, what a charming surprise...
I'm beginning to think you can't be without me.
You have managed to penetrate my armor, sir.
Am I disturbing you, perhaps?
Not at all, Emily
That's not what I said.
Go to bed, Louis, this is not the right time
Emily, if you don't mind, I've had an exhausting day. I can hardly stand.
Are you sending me away?
No! No, not at all, but I was thinking of going to bed to be honest.
Would there perhaps be a little space for me in your large and cold bed?
Invite her to say
Of course, Emily.
I can always make room for you.
Ah, by the way, congratulations on choosing Sir Gregory this evening.
You surprised me, I wasn't expecting it.
Why Emily, can't you read me like an open book?
Not as well as you read me, it would seem.
I'll teach you, if you'd like...
There's nothing I'd like more...
Ah, by the way, you surprised me during the conference.
Why is that?
Well... you are going to lose.
Why stay with Lord Mortimer?
I believe he has every chance of winning.
