I convinced Piaggi to reveal some important information to me
I inspired Péru to trust me
I could have inspired Péru to trust me
I succeeded in opening the entrance of the crypt without getting the statue wrong
I succeeded in opening the entrance to the crypt
I found my mother in the crypt
I could have found someone important in the crypt
Icarus
The son of Daedalus and Naucrate.
Impossible to mistake him with those wings!
After flying too close to the sun, they came unstuck and he fell to his death.
Pity.
Hmm...  the stone of the statue reminds me of the sword I picked up.
I get the feeling I'm back on your trail again, Mother! Hang on a little longer... 
Who's that?
It's Icarus, son of Naucrate and Daedalus.
The wax that kept his feathers together melted when he flew too close to the sun.
Translate the plaque
“I am the innocent one, sacrificed for the sins of the father”.
Remember the myth.
If I remember rightly, Icarus was the son of Daedalus.
He found himself confined to the labyrinth with his father, after his father betrayed Minos... 
And his father's plan to escape from the labyrinth wasn't any more successful.
Man, that kid was jinxed... 
There's something different.
Hey...  There's no crack here.
Move away
Let's keep going...

This note is about a meeting with Lord Mortimer, there's no doubt about it!
I need to find out where the sword that came with it is from, in order to find Mother.

You again?
Goddamnit, are you following me?
Wouldn't dream of it, Sir.
Well, Monsieur de Richet... 
What brings you here?
Looking for a new prey to thrash, is he?
And yourself? You wouldn't be looking for another woman to beat up by any chance, would you?
Right ! This conversation is over.
And yourself?
To tell the truth, I was wondering the same thing about you!
It's rare for guests to wander about in the garden.
I wanted to be alone for five minutes.
You look worried.
Worried...  no, not anymore.
Resolved would be a more exact term.
Resolved to do what?
Can I trust him?
If I tell you what I'm looking for, Monsieur Péru, will you promise to keep it to yourself?
Hell no.
And anybody who gives you a promise like that is an unmitigated liar!
Trust no one, Monsieur de Richet or you'll soon be a dead man... 
I bid you good luck, you'll need it... 
I'm trying to find out Mortimer's little secrets.
I'm not giving up.
You see, I sense there's something hidden in this garden and I intend to find out what it is... 
You've got some balls, I'll give you that..
Watch your back, though. There are no secrets here.
If Lord Mortimer finds out you've been searching his island, he'll make you pay dearly!
Thanks for the advice.
Are you going to denounce me then?
What's the point of answering, you wouldn't believe me anyway.
I'll be leaving now because whatever it is you're up to, I do NOT want to know .
Be seeing you.
SUCCESS
Tell me, aren't you even curious?
Curiosity killed the cat, Monsieur de Richet.
I admit, I may have judged you wrongly.
Watching you seek out Mortimer's little secrets might even be amusing, if I didn't already know the consequences.
See you later.
You fear Mortimer that much?
What scares you so much?
Don't mess with him, Monsieur.
If he offers his help, refuse it. Keep your freedom and get far away from here while you still can.
What did he do to you?
What happened to you, Monsieur?
It's time for me to assume the consequences of MY choices.
I've sold my soul to the devil, and now it's time to pay.
