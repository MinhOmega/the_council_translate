What consequences?
What do you mean by consequences?
You seem exhilarated by all this.
But if you continue down that path, you'll end up selling your soul to him too.
Well, I warned you.
Good luck to you, Monsieur.

I'm looking for my mother.
I'm still looking for my mother, of course.
You're right, Monsieur. Keep looking.
Good luck to you.
I dropped by on the off chance.
I just happened to be passing.
Of course you were... 
Say no more, I will take my leave. I certainly don't want to be mixed up in your plans.
Minos.
Son of Zeus and Europa.
If I remember correctly he was the King of Crete.
Married to Pasiphae, he had many children including the famous Ariadne, whom history remembers for her thread.
Hey, there's a crack in that statue.
On closer inspection, I think the sword I found at Mortimer's came from here. The stone, the erosion... 
I'd bet my life I'm on the right track!
Who's Minos again?
He and his queen, Pasiphae, were the monarchs of Crete.
Translate the plaque
“His gesture sealed his fate”.
Remember the myth.
In mythology, King Minos was known as a wise and just king. Despite the fact that he deceived Poseidon.
As punishment, his country was devastated by the white bull of the sea god and his wife became passionately in love with it.
From their union Asterion was born, sadly known to us as the Minotaur.
The illegitimate child, the child of shame...  who had a sorry fate.
And to think that Minos ended up as a judge of the Underworld...  Decidedly, the high and mighty always manage to get away with it... 
Observe the crack.
The crack is in the region of the heart.
Examine the crack
It's a thin crack as long as a finger. A blade could easily enter.
Thrust the sword into the crack

Asterion.
It is rare to see him like this.
In general, he's represented with the head of a bull, with the features of the Minotaur.
The famous son of Minos and Pasiphae.
Judging from the state of the statue, I'd bet my life this is where the sword I found came from.
Getting there!
Who's that again?
Asterion, son of Minos and Pasiphae.
Asterion, who had such a sad fate, and who the legend portrays as the horrible Minotaur.

“I am the cursed child”
Remember the legend.
Asterion was the son of Pasiphae and Minos, or rather the result of a curse put on Minos... 
Minos was punished...  for betraying Poseidon.
Of course...  as, strangely, it often happens, it wasn't he who was punished, it was his wife... 
She had to mate with a bull...  no less... 
From that union, Asterion was born who everyone knows as the famous Minotaur.
Rejected by Minos, he was shut up in the labyrinth so he could never leave.
And as if that wasn't bad enough, he died by the hand of a hero desperate to restore his reputation... 
Think about the meaning of the myth.
Technically, Asterion is the victim of the story because he's described as a child cast out from birth.
Born from an extramarital union because of the errors of his father, he was treated as an outcast all his life... 
And he died as innocently as he was born.
A tragic story, as the Greeks knew how to do so well... 
Return to the statue.
Observe the crack
The statue has a crack in it.
Examine the crack
The crack is thin and about as long as a finger. I should be able to thrust in my sword.
Thrust the sword into the crack.
Right...  we'll soon see.
Sorry, Asti, yet again your story does not end well.
Return
Remove the sword
Move away
