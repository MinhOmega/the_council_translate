What was that... That's the 3rd time in 3 days... 
Let's see if you're...  you're in there, Mother...

Let's see if you're...  you're in there, Mother... 
Ariadne... 
In Greek mythology, she helped Theseus to get through the labyrinth... 
Hmm, looks like there's a crack in the region of the heart... 
The state the stone of the statue is in reminds me of the sword.
I'll bet my boots this is where Mother wanted to lure Mortimer.
Just need to know why... 
Who is it again?
In Greek mythology, Ariadne helped Theseus out of the labyrinth.
Translate the plaque
“I guide the sword that will kill the monster”.
Remember your lessons... 
If I recall the Iliad, Ariadne is none other than the daughter of Minos and Pasiphae... 
She was in love with Theseus and helped him in his quest to kill the Minotaur in return for a promise of marriage if he defeated the monster.
She gave him a reel of thread so that he could find his way back through the labyrinth, which was famous for being unsolveable.
But once the beast was slain, the gallant was quick to abandon her on an island.
Turns out heroes are not what they once were... 
Observe the crack
Let's see... 
Examine the crack
A crack as long as my finger... 
Thrust a sword into the crack
Now what's going to happen if...  if I've got it wrong... 
Back
Pull out the sword.
Try something else.
Move away

Here's the famous Ariadne's thread... 
Thanks to which, if I remember rightly, Theseus avoided getting lost in the Labyrinth...

Bandages...  someone's been patching themselves up.
Looks like my mother took advantage of being in hiding to change her bandages, huh... 
This is silk...  She must have used her own clothes.
Inspect the bandages.
These bandages are pretty basic.
She'll be lucky if she doesn't get an infection.
Notice something.
Hmm, there are patches where the blood isn't totally clotted, that's a good sign, right?
