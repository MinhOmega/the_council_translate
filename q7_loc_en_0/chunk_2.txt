She changed them recently.
Which proves she's still looking after herself, and still believes in her chances.
I'd love to tell her to keep hanging in there.

Bandages...  someone's been patching themselves up.
Looks like my mother took advantage of being in hiding to change her bandages, huh... 
This is silk...  She must have used her own clothes.
Inspect the bandages.
These bandages are pretty basic.
She'll be lucky if she doesn't get an infection.
Notice something.
Hmm, there are patches where the blood isn't totally clotted, that's a good sign, right?

Don't move... 
Wait...  I'm not armed... 
Who are you?
Good God, Mother, what have... 
Tell me who you are!
Dammit, Mother, now what's happened?
Dammit, Mother, now what's happened?
Daedalus.
He is the architect of the labyrinth... 
And if I am not mistaken, he's also the father of Icarus.
The style of the statue reminds me of the sword I found.
I bet this is where my mother got it.
Who's Daedalus again?
If I remember rightly, he is the one who built the labyrinth for Minos.
Translate the plaque
“I am the architect of my own demise”
Remember the mythology
Architect and genius inventor, he built the labyrinth for Minos, to imprison the Minotaur.
I seem to recall that he told Ariadne how to get out of the labyrinth by tying a thread to himself... 
So, Theseus managed to exit the labyrinth without trouble, once the beast was dead.
And when Minos found him, he threw him into his own labyrinth along with his son Icarus.
Every action causes a reaction... 
Observe the crack
Hey! There's a crack in this statue, too.
Examine the crack
The crack is thin and about as long as a finger.
Thrust the sword into the crack
Right...  well, we'll soon see.
Return
Pull out the sword.
Alright, let's try again, you never know.
Move away
Let's continue...

Ahh!... What's wrong?!!
Either I'm imagining things or my hand was pricked... 
It had poison on it...  my head...  I feel hot...

I wonder what this kiosk is doing in the middle of the garden... 
Too cramped to be able to do much... 
There must be something going on there... 
Read the message on the plaque
"It's up to the just to deliver judgment. Truth unlocks all possibilities."
Examine the slab
Looks like this slab moves! I wouldn't be surprised if there was a passageway underneath it...

I eavesdropped on the conversation between Piaggi and Wollner
I could have eavesdropped on the conversation between Piaggi and Wollner
I could have convinced Piaggi to reveal some important information
