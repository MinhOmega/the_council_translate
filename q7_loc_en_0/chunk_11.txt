Son of Aegeus. He's the one who slayed the Minotaur.
Ah...  I think that's where the sword I found comes from. Looks like they've been carved from the same stone.
Theseus...  Who's that?
Ah, he's the son of Aegeus, he became the mythical King of Athens. The unifying king.
Pity he's generally only remembered for having slayed the Minotaur.
Translate the plaque
“Wrongly positioned, I am the blind hero”.
hmm...  I wasn't expecting an inscription like that.
Remember the legend.
I seem to recall he took the decision to confront the Minotaur... 
He killed the beast, but if it weren't for Ariadne's help, he would have been trapped in that labyrinth forever!
In short, yet another hero who wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Okay, okay, I'm...  I'm probably being a bit harsh, I mean, we do owe him the foundations of Athens. In other words, the Republic. “Render therefore unto Caesar what is Caesar's.”
Notice the crack
Looks like a crack has been made on his torso... 
Examine the crack
It's as long as a finger. I'd say between 6 and 8 centimeters.
Thrust the sword into the crack.
We will soon see... 
Return
Pull out the sword.
Let's try something else instead... 
Move away.
I wonder if Mother managed to solve this enigma... 
What's going on here... 
You can't be serious, Manuel...  you know that's not going to happen.
You must leave me alone now! I have agreed to everything...  Even to... 
Agreed? I wasn't aware you had a choice.
I... 
What now? What else must I do to win back my freedom?
Obey me. Now, get out!

Excuse me, my friend, I would like to be alone.
Of course, Mr President.
Is everything alright, my young friend?
Ask him about the sword.
Mr President...  you might be able to help me... 
I'd like to know where that sword comes from. Any idea?
Hmm, it reminds me of the statues in the garden.
I can't guarantee it but you ought to go and see, you never know, do you?
Thank you, Mr President.
You're quite welcome. See you soon.
Leave him
Wonderful!
Isn't that lovely? Well, see you later.
I am quite happy to be at your disposal if you should need my help with anything at all.
