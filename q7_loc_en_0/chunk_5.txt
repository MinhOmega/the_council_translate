Let's go!
Asterion.
It is rare to see him like this.
In general, he's represented with the head of a bull, with the features of the Minotaur.
The famous son of Minos and Pasiphae.
Judging from the state of the statue, I'd bet my life this is where the sword I found came from.
Getting there!
Who's that again?
Asterion, son of Minos and Pasiphae.
Asterion, who had such a sad fate, and who the legend portrays as the horrible Minotaur.

“I am the cursed child”
Remember the legend.
Asterion was the son of Pasiphae and Minos, or rather the result of a curse put on Minos... 
Minos was punished...  for betraying Poseidon.
Of course...  as, strangely, it often happens, it wasn't he who was punished, it was his wife... 
She had to mate with a bull...  no less... 
From that union, Asterion was born who everyone knows as the famous Minotaur.
Rejected by Minos, he was shut up in the labyrinth so he could never leave.
And as if that wasn't bad enough, he died by the hand of a hero desperate to restore his reputation... 
Think about the meaning of the myth.
Technically, Asterion is the victim of the story because he's described as a child cast out from birth.
Born from an extramarital union because of the errors of his father, he was treated as an outcast all his life... 
And he died as innocently as he was born.
A tragic story, as the Greeks knew how to do so well... 
Return to the statue.
Observe the crack
The statue has a crack in it.
Examine the crack
The crack is thin and about as long as a finger. I should be able to thrust in my sword.
Thrust the sword into the crack.
Right...  we'll soon see.
Sorry, Asti, yet again your story does not end well.
Return
Remove the sword
Move away
Let's go!
Pasiphae... 
Daughter of Perseus and sister of Circe, she married Minos and became the Queen of Crete.
I think the sword I found goes here. It's the same kind of stone.
Who's Pasiphae again?
A sacred character from Greek mythology.
Pasiphae was the Queen of Crete, and also the daughter of Perseus and the sister of Circe...  Nice family.

“Deliverance alone suffices not to wash away my humiliation.”
Remember the mythology.
I seem to recall that her fate was not something you'd want.
She was punished for the sins of her husband. She had to mate with the sacred bull of Poseidon.
Nine months later she gave birth to Asterion, better known as the Minotaur... 
It's crazy to see to what extent women have always been mistreated.
When they're not harpies, gorgons and other witches, they become victims.
Notice something.
She has no cracks.
For once justice is done. She won't pay for the errors of the others... 
Icarus didn't have any cracks either. Maybe the innocent are protected here. Let's hope it brings me good luck... 
Move away
Alright, let's continue anyways...

We must absolutely inform Sir Gregory.
How long has he been trying to collect all the spears?
I must have brought him the first one twenty odd years ago... 
Do you know if he has managed to get the original?
Well, in any case he's got all the ones we had at the Vatican. He made me replace them with copies.
But I don't understand your reaction. I'm sure it is nothing serious.
Ahaa! I can see very well you do not understand.
You have done nothing less than sign our death warrants, and still you don't understand.
I... Someone is listening!
What... 
Monsieur de Richet, why not join us rather than find yourself eavesdropping?
I...  I...  I didn't want to interrupt you, I'm sorry.
Of course, you didn't.
So, my son, what can we do for you?
Speak about the stone sword.
I was wondering if you might have seen an object like this here at the manor.
What are you playing at, de Richet?
I'm afraid I can't help you, my son.
Ask someone who knows the manor better than I do, one of the servants, for example. One of them is bound to help you.
Thank you for your advice, your Eminence
Delve deeper into their discussion... 
I didn't mean to spy on you, but you caught my attention.
What were you talking about?
