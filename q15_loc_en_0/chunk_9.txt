Emily surprised me
I'm sorry, Emma, it was all too quick.
I didn't believe for an instant that Emily would shoot.
Of course! How could poor Emily ever have a wicked thought?!
No, she's so sweet and innocent!  Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth!
I killed her...
I... What?!
She shot my mother and so I killed her.
I couldn't guess she would shoot...
Oh! Don't sass me!
You can change your tone because I'm not the one who shot at you, remember!
It's not my fault if your sister got rid of you like a dead weight!
I...
What you just said was nasty...
That was for treating me for an idiot.
I didn't want it to happen like that...
I just wanted to exist a little, too.
Did you ever think there might other ways to do that?
Obviously, it's easy to say that now.
It's her fault
Wait, Emma!
You're the one who passed yourself off as Emily.
You decided you wanted to play with us.
You pushed your sister to the edge and now this is the result!
It's got nothing to do with me!
I only wanted to exist for one, brief moment!
Spending my life in her shadow, being her double...it wasn't enough!
I must have taken up too much room again!
That's not what I said...
Only coming out for the basest of chores! How ungrateful of me to want to exist! To make my own choices!
It suits you to think that it's all my fault... But that is as it may be...
Louis, we have no time to lose.
Help me, please...
What on earth is she talking about?
Come on... I...
You are dead...
No! There's got to be a solution!
I am made of the same stuff as you! I already survived a gunshot at point blank range!
I will survive this!
Help me! I'll go mad if I stay here any longer!
...it's only been a few days...
I... What? Are you joking?!
I must have been here several months! I stopped counting from...
Hang on...
What are you doing here?
Are you dead?
Too bad for her! Leave her!
I don't have time to argue with you.
No, wait!
Don't leave me here!
There's nothing I can do for you, Emma.
You are dead...
No, but...
Good luck, Emma...
Explain to her
No, Sir Gregory brought my spirit here but I must get back as soon as possible.
It would take too long to explain
Look, never mind.
Don't take this the wrong way, but it would take too long to explain it all.
But you can move about, can't you?
I'm not dead, Emma.
So you should be able to help me!
No
I don't think there's anything I can do, Emma.
Good luck.
No, wait, don't leave me!...
Come back!!
I don't know
Emma, I have no idea of what's going on.
How do you expect me to help you?
There must be a way!
I beg you! Promise you will help me, Louis!
Promise to help her
Alright, calm down.
I'll do all I can to get you out of here.
Thank you, Louis!
I knew you were a good man!
Right, I must get going now.
Hang on in there, everything will work out fine!
Promise nothing
Emma, how can you expect me to promise anything under these conditions?
Don't leave me, Louis!
I don't want to get your hopes up, Emma.
I hope you understand...
Farewell
No, Louis!! NO!!
She got what she deserved
Maybe...
But don't count on it.
I... What??
You deserve what's coming to you, Emma, so don't count on me helping you!
No, Louis, you...
Farewell...
Is anyone there?
I can hear you... I know you are there.
Help me, help!
Can anyone hear me?
It's not fair, I don't deserve this...
I didn't do anything...
Help me, please!
