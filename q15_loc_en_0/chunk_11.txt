What are you doing here?
I was playing...
At what?
Oh really? And what were you playing at?
We... we were playing hide and seek... but I think I got lost...
I'm all on my own now...
Who with?
And who were you playing with?
With my sister...
But I can't find her.
Emily is here?
Tell me, Emma, is Emily here too?
Emily is always here...
But she makes fun of me... she keeps hiding in the shadows, to make me scared...
And I.. I get scared then... I don't want to follow her in...
I'm all on my own now...

You're back? You haven't abandoned me...
Right, what can I do?...
The poor thing seems completely lost...
Alright, Emma.
Don't worry, everything's going to be alright, you'll see.
Leave her!
This situation is completely beyond me...
All this doesn't exist! I have to find the way out of this dream!
Look, Emma, I'm sure you're sister isn't far.
What I suggest, is I go and have a look around and if I find her, I'll tell her to come and see you.
Alright?
Are you going to leave me on my own?
I'm going to see if I can find Emily.
I'll be quick.
No, I don't want to be on my own anymore...
I'll be back...
Help her, Louis!
Dry your tears, I'm here now.
You aren't going to abandon me?
No, don't worry. You are not alone.
Thank you, sir.
Tell me now, what happened with Emily?
We had a fight...
She was always wanting me to hide, I think.
But I don't want to play at hide and seek anymore.
Do you know why she always wanted to keep playing?
The one who wins, becomes the princess.
And it's never me who wins... But I want to be a princess too...
Alright.
And you like playing with your sister.
Of course, she's my sister.
And do you love your sister?
Yes, but sometimes she gets on my nerves.
But you wouldn't want her not to play with you anymore, would you?
Of course not...
It would be good if you could both play at being a princess together, at the same time, wouldn't it?
Together?
Yes, each with your own stories.
Oh... Yes, that would be good!
And we would have extraordinary adventures! And we could speak about them together and...
And...
And...
I miss her so much...
Emma? Is it you?
It's all your fault!
If your mother hadn't betrayed me, all this never would have happened!
If you and your mother hadn't come here, all this would never have happened!
You are all the same!
You're the one, Louis, who assassinated me!
You should be proud of yourself, you've finished what your mother started!
Emma, don't be like...
Leave me alone! I don't need you!
Don't take it like...
Leave me!
Leave me alone!
Help!...
Help me...
Is there anyone there?!
Help me, please...
I'm all alone...
Scum!
Bastards!
I'll get you back! You've all manipulated me!
I'll make you all pay, all of you!!
Good god, I can't even move... But Louis can.
What's happening?
Louis! Hurry, he's coming!
What's happening?!
I can sense him, he's here, he's trying to get inside me, Louis.
William has completely lost his mind!
He's getting ready to pull out all the stops!
He's going to devour my mind, Louis!! I'm not going to be able to stop him!
Louis, you are here, I sense your presence...
What... but he can't even see me...
Congratulations, my son, you have succeeded in joining us!
Louis, don't let him draw you in there!
You are signing your death warrant if you decide to follow him! I won't be there to protect you...
It's over, my son! We have won!
A new order can be born!
Louis, I'm so weak... I can feel him entering...
I.. I can no longer keep him out... he's... he's coming...
Tell him Mortimer is here
He's here...
