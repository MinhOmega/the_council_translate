Louis! No! Don't leave me!
LOUIS!!
Filthy scum! I'll kill you!
I'll get out of here and I'll come looking for you, Louis de Richet!!
DO YOU HEAR ME?!!
I WILL FIND YOU!!
Is anyone there?
I'm all alone...
Emma? What on earth...?
We only wanted to play... we...
We didn't mean any harm...
She sounds like a little girl talking...
It's me... Louis...
Oh, I know someone called Louis...
But he abandoned me, too.
What on earth is wrong with her?
It seems like her spirit has regressed...
What are you doing here?
I was playing...
At what?
Oh really? And what were we playing at?
We... we were playing hide and seek... but I think I got lost...
I'm all on my own now...
Who with?
And who were we playing with?
With my sister...
But I can't find her.
Emily is here?
Tell me, Emma, is Emily here too?
Emily is always here...
But she makes fun of me... she keeps hiding in the shadows, to make me scared...
And I.. I get scared then... I don't want to follow her in...
I'm all on my own now...
Continue
You're back? You haven't abandoned me...
Oh man, what can I do?...
The poor thing seems completely lost...
Everything is fine, Emma.
Don't worry, everything is going to be alright, you'll see.
Leave her!
This situation is completely beyond me...
All this doesn't exist! I have to find the way out of this dream!
Look, Emma, I'm sure your sister isn't far.
What I suggest is, I go and... and have a look around and... if I find her, I'll... I'll tell her to come and... and see you.
Ok?
Are you going to leave me on my own?
I'm going to see if I can find Emily.
I'll be right back.
No, I don't want to be on my own anymore...
I'll be right back... OKÂ ?
Help her, Louis!
I'm here now, dry your tears.
You aren't going to abandon me?
No, don't worry. You're not alone.
Thank you, sir.
Tell me now, what happened with Emily?
We had a fight...
She was always wanting me to hide, I think.
But I don't want to play at hide and seek anymore.
Do you know why she always wanted to keep on playing?
The one who wins, becomes the princess.
And it's never me who wins... But I want to be a princess too...
Ok, ok.
And you like playing with your sister.
Of course, she's my sister.
And do you love your sister?
Yes, but sometimes she gets on my nerves.
But you wouldn't want her not to play with you anymore, would you?
Of course not...
It would be good if you could both play at being a princess together, at the same time, wouldn't it?
Together?
Yes, each with your own stories.
Oh... Yes, that would be good!
And we would have extraordinary adventures! And we could speak about them together and...
And...
And...
I miss her so much...
Emma? Is that you?
It's all your fault!
If your mother hadn't betrayed me, all this would never have happened!
If you and your mother hadn't come here, all this would never have happened!
You are all the same!
You're the one, Louis, you're the one who assassinated me!
You should be proud of yourself, you've finished what your mother started!
Emma, don't be like...
Leave me alone! I don't need you!
Don't take it like...
Leave me!
Leave me alone!
Is... Is anyone there?
I'm all alone...
Emma? What on earth...?
We only wanted to play... we...
We didn't mean any harm...
You sound like a little girl talking...
It's me... Louis...
Oh, I know someone called Louis...
But he abandoned me, too.
What on earth is wrong with her?
It seems like her spirit has regressed...
