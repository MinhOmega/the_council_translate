He cut off all communication with Father and brought his children here!!
How could I not have seen it earlier!
He is going to absorb me! The traitor!
No one can stop him now!
Hurry, Louis! I absolutely must see you before it's too late!
If you have managed to follow my thoughts, come to me!! Quickly!!...
And the cherry on the cake, is I drank his cursed tea!
I deserve a great destiny, and I will let nothing, nor no one stand in the way of my dream!
I won't let him attack his brother!
I have to protect my sister. Help me, Louis!
Goddammit, I don't understand a thing! I'm doomed...
Looks like I've succeeded, they've all disappeared...
Louis! It's worked! But... Don't waste any time!
Yes, I'm coming!
At least... as soon as I've found the exit!
I can count on my father and my son to defend me... Yes, but will they make it in time?
What am I doing here now?
Nothing seems real...
You're nothing but a coward!
What a bunch of amateurs you are!
Please, keep calm!
What on earth is going on here?!
I don't understand a thing!
Louis, don't waste any time!
Appease them, my thoughts are becoming confused...
Help me!
Be quick!
Yes...
Not a minute to lose!
Analyse this situation
One thing is for sure, my mother and Wöllner have the same objective: to find that book.
They're following the same trail and must be close to each other.

I need to keep an eye on them...
He wants to isolate me again!
Analyse this situation
That's not really Elizabeth, it's another Daemon... Who wants to protect Holm from Mortimer...
On a symbolic level, he should be placed between the two of them.

Analyse this situation
Emma is completely lost. She needs to be close to her sister.
As for Emily, she no longer trusts anyone. Apart from me that is... I have to stay by her side.
Leave
Stay with me, Louis! We must take Al Azif back from him!
Whatever happens, I trust him and only him! I must take the book back to him...
I'm so lucky to serve Lord Mortimer...
"Beneath your compassion, we take refuge, O Mother of God:"
Sarah? Is that you ?
Louis???
Louis, can you hear me? I'm here, Louis!
Can you see me?
Of course!
But, I don't understand...
Ah merciful heaven! You CAN see me!!!
Yes, I...
Louis, I don't know what's happening but you must help me!
Look just... just calm down...
I can't see you, Louis!
I'm here right in front of you...
No, I can't see you. The quays are deserted!
I can't leave, Louis! Help me!
You died...
Died? No! What are you talking about?!
Look, I am right here!
We are in the Ether
We're not on the quays.
Yes, we are, I haven't moved!
I promise you, I wish you were right!  But you're not.
It would seem that we're in what they call the Ether.
Their world of spirits!...
I was sure it existed!...
The poor woman is completely losing touch with reality...
What you see is not real.
I'm not sure I understand myself
It's just as confusing for me.
I... I'm no better off than you, I... I don't really understand everything that's going on...
All I can say is, what we see isn't real.
Her spirit is here because she's a Daemon
And as you are my sister...
It's possible that Daemons don't completely disappear after their physical bodies die.
But... But how is that possible ? Dammit!
I'm stuck here!
I don't know, I... I'm only guessing...
Only your physical body is dead. Apparently your spirit is kept here.
I daren't try understand... I...
Am I condemned?
Look, neither of us know anything about this situation really...
Help me, Louis!
You are the first one, the only one, to see me... To speak to me...
Without you, I'll never get out of here!
Don't leave me like this! I beg you!
I am a prisoner too
Me neither... For the moment I'm stuck here, too...
After all you're the occult expert, you must have some idea... you tell me...
Not a single one.
I won't stand for this... No, this is simply impossible...
I... I must focus on a solution...
Too bad for her!
Next time you want to abduct a child and lie to him his whole life, maybe you'll think twice.
Louis, no! Don't leave me here!
