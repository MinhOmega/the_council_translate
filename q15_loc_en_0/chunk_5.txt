Leave 
Emily?
Louis... Louis!
Who on earth is...
Louis, where are you? I can't see you!!
In front of you, Emily...
She can't see me...
Louis, are you dead too?!
It's complicated...
I thought Emma killed you....
Ah, yes, that's right... She still doesn't know everything I've found out...
Emma is dead
Emily... I have to tell you that Emma is dead....
I... Well...
Justice has been done!
Emma has gone mad
After her crime... Emma descended into madness.
You... Are you insinuating that she wasn't responsible for her actions?
It is probable...
Apologize for getting them mixed up
I feel responsible for what happened to you, Emily...
I made a mistake...
I've been thinking it over... No one forced her, Louis!
She would have ended up doing it in another place, another time... But she still would have done it!
It bears no importance here
I understand that it must be difficult to forgive her, but if you think about it...
Salvation won't be found in anger, Emily.
It's all so unfair, Louis!
A part of me does understand her actions...
To hell with good intentions!
On the contrary, I believe now is the perfect time to decide how you want to live your life.
In bitterness or in peace?
Think about it, Emily...
Say nothing
...
But... I thought...
How is it that you are here?
Can you move around?
I can't explain...
Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to explain what's happening to us, Emily.
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you are...
But you can move around...
Maybe because I'm not dead?
Explain to her about the Daemons and the Ether
I'm going to have to be a bit blunt here, Emily.
You'll have to excuse me but it's quite baffling...
Mortimer and Holm are age-old spirits who can change bodies.
I... What?!
They're Daemons...
Louis, are you feeling alright?
And I am one too.
Louis, you don't seem very well at all...
Because William Mortimer is my father.
And he's yours too, yours and Emma's.
He's bestowed certain powers on me, like how to read a human mind, and even how to control it...
Look, I know... It's a lot to take in.
Are you alright?
Yes... Actually, no, how do you expect me to feel?
It would be easier if you told me you'd simply lost your mind, or even that I've lost my mind, which would at least make some sense...
If only something inside me didn't vibrate at the sound of your words...
I'm not making it up, Emily. You've got to believe me...
And where are we then?
In the Ether, I think.
Think of it as a psychic dimension...
Oh. Well, that explains it, then....
Do you have anymore bedtime stories like that?
Well... you are dead.
Yes... of course I am.
I should have known. Ask a stupid question...
Yes, I know, Emily. It's... it's hard to believe but even if it seems insane, I... I assure you that it's all true.
We are dead and we're talking in the Ether.
Well... Not exactly. You see I'm not dead.
What? But...
If you are here without being dead... Then there must be a way out!
Help me, Louis!
I am begging you, help me!
Let's help her!
I'll do everything I can to find a solution.
You... You promise?
Yes, trust me!
I can't promise anything...
I'd... I'd rather be honest, Emily...
I'm not going to make any false promises here.
But...
Louis, please!
I'm sorry.
You can say that because you're not the one who's stuck here!
Adieu, Emily... Adieu...
No! No, don't abandon me! Louis!
Reassure her
Clearly it seems like there must be some way of getting you out of here...
So technically, yes, I don't see what could stop you...
Do you really think so?
Oh nothing much surprises me now!
I must go...
Wait! Wait, don't leave me! For pity's sake, Louis!
But I must, if I'm... I'm to find a solution...
Be brave, Emily!
