Be brave, Emily!
I... yes, I understand...
I trust you...
I'll be back.
... My own sister!
I should have left her to die when the Tsarina caught her!
I really am so stupid!
It was obvious that she would betray me one day!
That bitch!
Louis!
Help!!
Don't leave me!!
Louis?
LOUIS!!!
Come back!!
Emily?
Louis...
You were reciting something?
A prayer of atonement.
It's my punishment, Louis. For what I did to Emma.
And for what I did to Sarah...
I must do penance for all my sins...
No, you are mistaken...
It's... it's a lot more complex than that...
You're in the Ether and...
It's well deserved!
What exactly were you hoping for, after everything that's happened?
You're going to be able to think about all the things you've done, Emily!
I am dead, Louis!
I am stuck at the place of my death, and I can't seem to move.
And I'm talking to an apparition that represents precisely why I lost my mind...
The one for whom I committed the unforgivable!
Emily, listen to me, I assure you...
No.
No, that's enough... I can't bear it anymore!
Even in death, I have to pay for my errors...isn't being dead payment enough!?
I am damned, leave me alone, demons!
I don't want to listen to you anymore!
Off with you, Satan!!!
Leave her, Louis. There's nothing you can do for her...
Very well, Emily. Very well...
Emily?
Louis...
I wasn't expecting anybody... let alone you.
Me neither, actually...
You were reciting...
A prayer of atonement.
I must pay for my sins, Louis. I finally understand!
It's my punishment, Louis. For my act against Emma.
And for what I did to Sarah...
I must do penance for all my sins...
No, you are mistaken...
It's a lot more complex than that...
You are in the Ether and...
It's well deserved!
What exactly were you hoping for, after everything that has happened?
You are going to be able to think about all the things you've done, Emily!
I am dead, Louis!
I am stuck at the place of my death, and I can't seem to move.
And I'm talking to an apparition that represents precisely why I lost my mind...

Emily, listen to me, I assure you...
No
No, that's enough... I can't bear it anymore!
Even in death, I have to pay for my errors...isn't being dead payment enough!?
I am damned, leave me alone, demons!
I don't want to listen to you anymore!

Leave her, Louis. There's nothing you can do for her...
Very well, Emily.
Mindful, alas! That we ourselves
Have had a share
In such great indignities,
Which we now deplore from the depths of our hearts,
We humbly
Ask your pardon
And declare our readiness
To atone by voluntary expiation,
Not only for our own personal offenses,
But also for the sins of those,
Who, straying far from the path of salvation,
Refuse in their obstinate infidelity
To follow you,
Their Shepherd and Leader
Or, renouncing the vows of their baptism,
Have cast off the sweet yoke of your law.
In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
I confess, my God...
I have sinned!
Away from me, Satan!
Never again will I heed your words!
In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
Good god, I can't even move... But Louis can.
What's happening?
What? What are you doing here?
Emma?
YOU!
It wasn't enough for you to let me be killed!
You have to come here and start babbling away at me!?
