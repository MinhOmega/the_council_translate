Leave
You again?
Who's there?
Elizabeth? But I saw you dead!
Elizabeth? But you left!
Gregory?
No... No, you are not Gregory...
Something's not right... Gregory, you are in danger...
Elizabeth... What's the matter?
WHO ARE YOU?
Introduce yourself
My name is Louis de Richet!
Sarah de Richet's son
Sarah de Richet's son!
Sarah... I know someone called Sarah...
An impure... a spawn of William...
No, you cannot be her son... She couldn't have children...
William Mortimer's son
William Alexander Mortimer's son!
William?!
Oh... I see...
Don't tell him who you are!
No point shouting.
Before asking that, at least...
Empty words!
You refuse to tell me who you are... But I will find you...
No one can escape me...
Say nothing
Make yourself very small, Louis...
It's useless trying to hide!
I will find you...
Go away, Louis!
Don't stay here, Louis...
What's happening here?
My son is in danger...
Talk!
Talk about him

What's wrong?
Whom do I have the honor of addressing?
You are just a fool, a mere child...
I have no time to waste with you...
Dammit, who is that now?
What are you...?
That?... Is that what you call me?
Be careful, your audacity might cost you dearly.
Let's try to find out who I am speaking to...
Sir, rest assured, I have no quarrel with you.
With all due respect, would you mind telling me to whom I am speaking, please?
I would not like to make a blunder.
I see you are trying to be civil.
I accept your ignorance and agree to answer you.
I am the Father of all, founder of our house, grand architect of the laws that govern us and creator of he who you call...
Gregory Holm, at this moment, yes, as well as all of his brothers and sisters.
Damn, it's Holm and Mortimer's father...
But why am I hearing you through Elizabeth Adams?
So that is how you see me, is it?
Here, everything is mere make-believe.
Your mind is working to give me an appearance that will allow you to see me...
He is the voice that Elizabeth kept hearing!
You're the one who Elizabeth kept hearing in her head!
You're the one who gnawed at her from inside, year after year!
Who dares speak to me in that tone of voice?
She spent her life trying to escape from you!
And it was all for nothing!
No one can escape from me!
Go back
Speak about Elizabeth

I thought Elizabeth was alive
Is Elizabeth still alive?
She is...
Was it you who prompted her to leave?
Yes
Yes, she felt...
What gives you the right?
I didn't mean any harm...
Young fool!
She allowed me to find out what was going on with my sons...
Stop interfering in my business!
No 
No, I haven't the...
Lies! I sense you are lying...
You have spoken to her...
You've been talking together...
I see... wine...
Concentrate, Louis, he's reading your thoughts!
Sarah... You are thinking about that poor Sarah...
She spoke to you about voices. Elizabeth spoke to you about me...
And you didn't believe her
And you believed her...
I thought Elizabeth was dead
I thought you were dead!
I am not Elizabeth Adams...
She was killed... brutally...
Who killed her? Tell me!
Tell him you don't know
I haven't the faintest idea...
Very well.
