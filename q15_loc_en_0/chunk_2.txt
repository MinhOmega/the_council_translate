You know, don't you. Why hide the truth from me?
Are you the one...?
No! No, it's not you... But you know who did it...
One last time...
Who killed Elizabeth Adams?
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Don't mention Mortimer
Listen, I don't...
William!!!
It's William!
Ah! I'm sure it is...
But I... I didn't say anything...
No need...
Don't think about anything
Concentrate...
Ah, you resist...this is almost...charming...
Shall I show you what true conviction is?
WHO KILLED ELIZABETH ADAMS?
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
It's just... I don't... William...
That is good, my child.
Say nothing
Shut up, Louis...
That's none of my business...
Oh? You would rather say nothing, would you?
Fine... Never mind...
Tell him it's Mortimer
I think Lord Mortimer is the one who is responsible for all of this...
It was to be expected...
I didn't think he would dare to...
But he did!
Is it he who possessed Elizabeth?
Is it you who...
Your question is irrelevant..
Elizabeth was just a receptacle which allowed me to observe William's actions.
But I... I didn't even ask the question!
You thought it...
What did he do to Elizabeth?
But tell me, what happened with Eliz...
That's enough!
Do you think you can question me?
Do you really have no idea who I am?
Go back
Talk about the situation

Tell him that you are for Mortimer
I'm one of Lord Mortimer's allies.
I'm here for the conference.
Yes, I see that you're telling the truth.
Is the conference over?
Yes. But I don't think that's important anymore...
Gregory!
What happened?
Well, apparently...
Speak!
Mortimer, he... he poisoned him!
AH! BETRAYAL!
He dared break the rules! He will be tracked down and punished for this!
Liar!
I see you helped my son Gregory!
And you did well.
However, just remember one thing... Lie to me again and it will cost you dearly...
Tell him that you are for Holm
I'm one of the guests of the conference, an ally of Sir Gregory.
You are telling the truth.
Is the conference over?
Yes.
Not only did Lord Mortimer win the vote, it seems he also planned to get rid of Sir Gregory by poisoning him.
Sir Gregory won the vote but it seems that Lord Mortimer hadn't planned on him winning and poisoned him...
What?! How vile!!
Gregory came on my approval! How dare Mortimer attack his own brother!
He will pay for this!
Liar!
I see that you serve the interests of William!
I see...
Gregory! You poisoned him!
It wasn't me, I haven't done anything...
Scoundrel! How dare you!
I assure you, I knew nothing about it!
Ah! Now you're telling the truth...
William! I should never have trusted you at all!
You will pay!
Holm is going to die
Sir Gregory has been poisoned...
What?!!
Who dares attack my son?
It would seem it was Lord Mortimer...
William! That vile little traitor!
He dared overstep our family rules!
"No member of the family will you kill!"
The dog! He will pay for this!
Go back
