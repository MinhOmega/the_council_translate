Good luck...
Calm her down
Listen... You have to stay positive.
Seeing as I've entered the Ether I... I must be able to leave it... If it's possible for me, then it's possible for you...
Do you really think so?
Rational and open... RememberÂ ?
I... yes, right... you are right!
There must be a solution...!
But how come you can move around?
I'm not dead.
I don't understand!
I think there are many things that you don't understand.
It doesn't matter! I trust you!
You are going to help me, aren't you?
I must be getting on. I... I can't stay much longer.
Louis, I beseech you! Promise you're going to help me!
Promise her
Of course I'm going to help you, Mother...
Thank you, Louis...
I trust you! Thank you...
Leave her!
Farewell.
No! LOUIS, NO!!
DON'T LEAVE ME!!!
Pretend you are going to help her
Of course I'm going to help you, Mother...
Thank you, Louis...
I trust you! Thank you...
Sarah?
Louis???
Louis, can you hear me? I'm here, Louis!
Can you see me?
Of course!
I don't understand...
Aaah merciful heaven! YOU CAN SEE ME!!!
Yes, I...
Louis, I don't know what's happening but you must help me!
Calm dow...
I can't see you, Louis!
I'm here in front of you...
No, I can't see you. The quays are deserted!
I can't leave, Louis! Help me!
You died three days ago...
Died? No, what are you talking about?!
Look, I am right here!
We are in the Ether
We are not on the quays.
Yes, we are, I haven't moved!
I promise you, I wish you were right!  But you are not.
But it would seem that we are in what they call, the Ether.
Their world of spirits!...
I was sure it existed!...
The poor thing is completely losing touch with reality...
What you see is not real.
I'm not sure I understand myself
It's just as confusing for me.
I'm no better off than you... I don't really understand everything that's going on...
All I can say is, what we see isn't real.
Her spirit is here because she's a Daemon
And as you are... my sister...
It's possible that Daemons don't completely disappear after their physical body dies?
But... But why dammit?
I'm stuck here!
I don't know, I'm only guessing...
Only your physical body is dead. Apparently your spirit is kept here.
I daren't try understand... I...
Am I condemned?
Look, neither of us know anything about this situation...
Help me, Louis!
You are the first to see me... To speak to me...
Without you, I'll never get out of here!
Don't leave me like this! I beg you!
I am a prisoner too
Me neither... For the moment I'm stuck here, too...
You must have an idea...
Not a single one.
I won't stand for it... No, this is simply impossible...
I... I must focus on a solution...
Too bad for her! 
Next time you want to abduct a child and lie to him all his life, maybe you'll think twice.
Louis, no! Don't leave me here!
Good luck...
Calm her down
Listen... You have to stay positive.
