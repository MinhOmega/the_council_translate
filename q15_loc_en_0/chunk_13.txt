They were contemporaries of Louis XIV. This has nothing to do with what brought Holm here.
I ought to look somewhere else.
Ignore
Ah Charles Fran√ßois... What an adventure..
Listen to the entire memory
France... So much effort, so much wasted time!
From Charles Martel to the wars of religion...
I simply did not consider Protestantism to be a real threat and that was my greatest mistake!
My faith in Father and the Catholic Church that he administered made me blind, I can see that now...
I lost France through 100 years of war...
Follow this memory
That's not the right direction.
I must concentrate on the important memories, the ones that led Holm into this situation.
Analyze the memory
The analysis is correct.
But there's no link to what interests me here.
Ignore
France... So much effort, so much wasted time!
Listen to the entire memory
I recall Sparta, of my exchanges back then with my brother...
I did everything in my power to avoid the Peloponnesian War but he wouldn't listen! He always wanted more...
Father wasn't gentle with William back then.
Shutting him in the body of Pericles for 8 years, and reducing Athens and its cursed democracy to its knees...
Follow this memory
I'm losing focus... Come on Louis, concentrate, concentrate!
I must concentrate on the important memories, the ones that led Holm into this situation.
Analyze the memory
One of Holm's distant memories and one of his brother's? With an ego like his, he's undoubtedly talking about Mortimer.
Could there be a link here?
No, at the time they weren't enemies like they are today!
Ignore
I recall Spartacus.
Listen to the entire memory
Dear Countess d'Hunolstein... What a pity you disappointed me!
Managed to swindle La Fayette for the damage he did to the western monarchies...
...So full of remorse once it was done, I don't really regret making you steal the necklace and end up in a convent...
Follow this memory
No, not that way... I'm losing the thread here.
I must concentrate on the important memories, the ones that led Holm into this situation.
Analyze the memory
I heard about this story.
The countess was apparently an acquaintance of Sir Gregory, but this has nothing to do with what's happening at the manor.
I can put that one to the side...
Ignore
Dear Countess d'Hunolstein... What a pity you disappointed me!
I reconstructed the sequence of memories of Sir Gregory Holm
I restored order among the guests
I escaped from the Ether 
I met Asahel's spirit
I could have met Asahel's spirit
I met  Emma Hillsborrow's spirit
I could have met Emma Hillsborrow's spirit
I met Emily Hillsborrow's spirit
I could have met Emily Hillsborrow's spirit
I met Sarah de Richet's spirit
I could have met Sarah de Richet's spirit
I confirmed my support for Lord Mortimer
I confirmed my support for Sir Gregory Holm
I tried to read Asahel's spirit and was rejected
I accepted Asahel's spirit
I accepted Sir Gregory Holm's spirit
I abandoned Sir Gregory Holm to become allied to Lord Mortimer
I chose to serve only the Humans
Dear God, if I lose the war against France, I will be doomed!
I can't hold out...
He broke the rules...
His children... are gathered together? Yes, here...
Be quick!
Louis!
I must speak to you!
He's coming!
Come to me!
I didn't want to believe it...
Wh... But...
What on earth is happening?
I'm dreaming or...
Louis! It's me Gregory! Listen, we don't have much time!
But where are we?
Louis, I brought us here.
You must act swiftly, I can't hold out for long.
William has poisoned me, he must have used the blood of a former Daemon!
I am no longer able to enter the body of someone else.
The poison is gnawing away at me from the inside! I... I'm going to die, Louis...
But where are we?
In the Ether...
What you see is not real, it's only a mental projection created by my spirit.
I'm occupying William's spirit at the moment but I'm not going to be able to keep it up forever.
Join me, Louis, otherwise all will be lost!
Yes! Yes, I'll join you.
Find a way... Hurry...
I must find them quickly...
Wh... But...
What on earth is happening?
I'm dreaming or...
Louis! It's me Gregory! Listen, we don't have much time!
But where are you?
Louis, I brought us here.
You must find us quickly, I can't hold out for long.
William has poisoned me, he must have used the blood of a former Daemon!
I am no longer able to enter the body of someone else.
