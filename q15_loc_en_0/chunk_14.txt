The poison is gnawing away at me from the inside! I... I'm going to die, Louis...
But where are we?
In the Ether...
What you see is not real, it's only mental projections created by my spirit.
I'm occupying William's spirit at the moment but I'm not going to be able to keep it up forever.
Join me, Louis, otherwise all will be lost!
I'm coming!
Find the way... Hurry...
I must find them quickly...
What?... But... I'm still in the conference room...
What on earth is going on here?...
If nothing is real, I'll have to be careful!

Listen to the entire memory
It was a trap right from the start.
At the previous conference, three years ago, I'm sure he already knew I would bring the Hillsborrow sisters here.
He knew it! He knew it! He already knew they were his daughters!

This is the first event that brought Holm here.
Oh yeah, I'm on the right track...
Analyze the memory
The previous conference. That's when Mortimer started putting his plan into action!
That's how this whole thing began.
Ignore
It was a trap right from the start.
Listen to the entire memory
He allowed me to bring Emily back again to this conference.
Supposedly to find her sister, whereas Emma hadn't even disappeared yet!
The poor wretch was shot as her sister was setting foot on the island.
I should have understood that earlier!

No, not yet...
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
I'm on the right track here...
Analyze the memory
It's about my first vision on the island! The day of my arrival.
This could be the beginning of the story, yet Holm is talking about bringing Emily back again.
So there must have been something before this.
Ignore
He allowed me to bring Emily to this conference.
Listen to the entire memory
And coincidentally, who arrives at the same time as Emily?
Louis de Richet! His son!
He brings his four children together and even then, I didn't react...

There's something missing.
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
I'm getting closer to him.
Analyze the memory
This is about my arrival. As well as Emily's.
There must be an earlier memory that talks about my sisters!
Ignore
And coincidentally, who arrives at the same time as Emily?
Listen to the entire memory
And when Elizabeth disappeared, I...
No... it's not possible! I couldn't have missed that, not me!
He cut me off from our Father and I didn't say a word!
Follow this memory
I must have missed a memory...
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
One more.
Analyze the memory
Elizabeth's presence was crucial for Holm. If she was still here, he'd still be alive.
This memory is important, without a shadow of a doubt.
It took place after my arrival with Emily and Cardinal Piaggi but well before I found out the truth about my nature.
Ignore
And when Elizabeth disappeared, I...
Listen to the entire memory
He feeds Louis and I continue to see nothing...
He stuffed his poor son with an occult knowledge that we usually take months to give to our children!
And Louis is only trying his best to get by... he doesn't realize he's being led to the slaughter!
Follow this memory
What have I missed?
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
Getting to the end here.
Analyze the memory
So Holm seems certain that Mortimer has been using me...
But I get the impression that he's only had this vision recently...
It's one of the last ones he had.
Ignore
He feeds Louis and I continue to see nothing...
Listen to the entire memory
And the cherry on the cake, is I drank his cursed tea!
He knew I would drink it! The rascal knows me better than I do myself!!
Follow this memory
I should come back to this later.
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
Analyze the memory
The blood that Mortimer used is deadly poison for a Daemon. Holm won't survive it.
It's over for him. He's finished...
Ignore
He trapped me!!
He poisoned me to stop me from being able to leave this body!
