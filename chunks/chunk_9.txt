You are in deep trouble, my young friend!
Monsieur de Richet? At last we meet.
Lord Mortimer?
I do apologize for being late, I was obliged to clear up some... urgent business.
I know you're concerned about your mother. But before we can talk about that, I need to inform you that... Miss Adams has been found in her room.
Is she feeling better?
You weren't made aware?
I'm afraid Elizabeth Adams died during the night.
No, no
Nothing of interest...
Did you find anything, Louis?
Not so far.
Maybe this paper...
No.
It's a real museum here...
Are you enjoying the visit?
A golden fleece...
It's freezing, hurry up.
Advise her to use the hide
Cold? You want a rug? It'll warm you up.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that horrible thing.
That's a pity, the gold color brings out your eyes
And your flattery brings out your boorishness.
Do you think it's the Golden Fleece?
Do you think that can really be Jason's golden fleece?
No. You are aware that Jason and the Argonauts is a myth, aren't you?
But Mortimer's been protecting this hide. It must of great value, don't you think?
Certainly of historical value. This kind of hide is still used by gold diggers in Eastern Europe.
Now you see how easy it is to obtain a legend.
Why do you have to act so nonchalant every time I show you something?
Louis, anyone can kill a sheep, rip off its hide and say it's the Golden Fleece.
We're at Lord Mortimer's', not at some farmyard fair. You're just too skeptical
And you have a tendency to believe anything. Talk about an unlikely pair!
Yet, you know opposites attract, don't you?.
Say nothing
"Where all eyes size you up"...
Chances are, that's the room my mother spoke of!
And she also spoke of a Medusa. Should I go and try to find the creature now?

I've resolved the enigma of the Medusa
I've found out that Emily was hiding something
I persuaded Emily to tell me her secret
I didn't persuade Emily to tell me her secret
I could have spent the night with Emily
I had a few drinks with Elizabeth
I left Elizabeth's place before I got drunk
I spent the night with Emily
I could have found out more about the past of Elizabeth and my mother
I could have joined Emily in my room
I discovered Lord Mortimer's room where he hides his treasure
I accepted to keep Elizabeth company
I preferred to join Emily in my room
The only person sizing me up here, is that monumental Zeus.
It can't be here...

If I respect the legend, I have to place the hero holding the shield in front of the Medusa.
Except for here, it doesn't work, there must be something else.

It looks right but nothing's happening.
Maybe, in this position, the hero with the shield is just dazzling his colleague...

Alright, let's recap... before dinner, I was going to investigate my mother's message.
I've got to find the place: "Where all eyes size you up."

Open the Jar
Emily? What if I open the jar? Would that then make men responsible for all the evils?
Try! It'll make a change.
Alright, can we move on now?
I do love your irony but honestly, are you ever impressed by anything you see?
By a chamber pot? No, you'll need to do better than that!
Open the Jar
Right... we'll soon see. If it really is the original Pandora's box, I guess we'll be in store for some misery sooner or later.
Don't open the Jar
Actually, I'd rather not open it.
You're afraid, aren't you?
Have you ever heard of the Ark of the Covenant?
Yes.
A piece of advice: if you come across it: don't open it, you'll thank me.
Read the inscription
Ancient Greek. Translated, it reads: â€œThe all-gifted.'
Could this jar be the original Pandora's box?
Emily, I've found Pandora's box! It's not as impressive as I thought it would be. But that's how these things usually go.
I detest that legend. Once again, women are made responsible for all of the world's evils.
And stop playing with that pot, you'll break it. Come on, let's move on.
Examine the symbols
The heavenly symbols refer to Pandora's box.
Emily! I'm pretty sure I've got Pandora's box!
Of course, you have. You see an earthen pot and you immediately assume it can only be Pandora's box. Logical!
What I like about you, Louis, is that you never fail to surprise me.
Leave
Carry on searching!
Guess what I've found.
The Holy Grail!
Older than that.
