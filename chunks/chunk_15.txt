I know this legend
In Greek mythology, anyone who looked into the eyes of the Medusa turned to stone.
So the monster's statue must be turned toward someone who can protect their eyes.
It can only be the hero holding the shield.
Remember de Richet's message
The clue I found said: “Beware Hero, the beast always charges the best protected. That is its weakness.”
That's the key. The best protected hero is the one holding the shield.
Thank you, Mother!

Handle the mechanism
Hmm, the mechanism is worn here.
Whenever the shield is not turned toward the sword, the machinery freezes up. The statue must have been in this position most of the time.
Betrayed by the marks of time. So that makes it easy. The shield must face the sword.
Consider the optics
Let's think: to vanquish the beast, the statues have to be lined up in a specific order.
What can this shield be for? To protect its holder?
Why not? But in that case, what's the lantern for?
Step back and take a second, Louis... be logical, but open minded. Think outside the box.
Nobody said a statue has to have only one use. I wonder if the lantern was to distract the Medusa.
The shield can both protect the holder, and also reflect the light from the lantern to distract the beast.
In other words, I'll have to make an angle of ninety degrees between the lantern and the Medusa by turning the shield to face the sword.
If Mortimer's the one who thought of all this stuff then, honestly, he must have a screw loose. Crazy idea... but worth a shot!
Think about the configuration

Assess the statuette
The statue is darker on the right-hand side.
It must be often placed toward the fire, which would explain the difference in color.
In that case, it would be facing the Medusa.
Perfect for the coup de grace!
Examine the sword
This hero is the only one holding a weapon.
It seems obvious that he's the one whose job is to cut off her head.
So, sword toward the Medusa.
