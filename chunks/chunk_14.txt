Analyze the documents
See those fine scratches around the words?
Yes, and?
The ink barely spreads on the paper. It spreads exactly the same way on the signature.
The deed was written using the same ink. If it is a fake, then it's a professional job.
Analyze the documents
These documents are intriguing but do you really think that's what attracted your mother's attention here?
And how do you know my mother was interested in this room?
I didn't know, I just supposed she was. And you just confirmed it. So? Do you think she found what she came for?
I don't know. She was obsessed with Mortimer and I must confess these property deeds are troubling.
If that's the case, why would she have left them?
Once again, I don't know. We'll have to ask her when we find her. And what's your take?
What do you think of this collection?
Mortimer's collection is unique, isn't it?
That's an understatement. No doubt he has a major passion for history and fine art. Or getting gifts.
If each time Mortimer does someone a favor, they reward him with a priceless gift,
... that means he must have helped nearly everybody in the world.
Why conceal these assets?
Why keep such a collection hidden in a secret room. Any thoughts?
Mortimer has every reason in the world to conceal it. Even if only to keep it from people like us.
Hey, Emily, we're not thieves. We're only looking.
How has it all been acquired?
How did Lord Mortimer get all this? It's just crazy!
Secret connections, money, or a well-kept family treasure passed on from generation to generation.
Who knows...
That would mean some of Mortimer's ancestors lived before Jesus was born.
I wonder why my mother didn't make it clear what she was interested in here.
She didn't have time to write it down or maybe she wasn't sure of what she was looking for.
Or she wanted to protect her discoveries... it's disturbing.
You'll just have to search the rest of the room. Maybe you'll find something.
I've found an amazing ring.
There's an inscription engraved on it.
Ask Emily about her marriage
You are married. Why don't you wear a wedding ring?
You mean wear something just to prove your love? Not my style.
Pretend to propose with the ring
Emily, when I see that ring, I can no longer hold back my feelings for you.
Oh, stop it, you're being ridiculous.
What d'you mean? I was just about to get down on one knee.
Translate the inscription
The mythical Ring of the Nibelung.
Louis, do you really believe it's the ring of the legend?
You should try it on. They say if you wear it on your finger, it makes you more agreeable.
How drole! In the legend it's a cursed ring.
Say nothing
The spear that pierced Christ.
Of Course. Only the Holy Grail's missing...

The Medusa...
A hero armed with a sword...
Hmm... A hero with a lantern.
And the last one holding a shield.
I'll stake my life on it: all the statues form a single scene together. The poor devils are about to face the beast.
Let's give them a helping hand.

Think about the configuration
Now Louis, it's time to keep a logical mind, as every good scientist should.
The aim is to defeat the Medusa, so what can the lantern be for?
To light up the Medusa? Hardly likely. The hero holding the lantern will be easy prey and the shield will be of no use.
To light up the sword? No, that makes no sense. So that leaves the shield...
Mmm... I wonder if the aim is to play with the light. If I turned the shield right, the light would be reflected.
The ray of light will perturb the Medusa and focus her attention on the best protected hero.
Pretty smart.
But it also means I'll have to make sure I get the shield positioned just right.
Consider the value of the Lantern
When I see the lantern and the shield, I can't help thinking back to my childhood.
Mr Dorffer, our teacher, I used to drive him insane.
As soon as the sun came out, I got a kick out of distracting him with the inkwell, by deflecting the light with it.
I'd turn it in such a way as to direct a spot of light onto his face. Not strong enough to dazzle him but just enough to annoy him.
Hey, what if I tried to annoy the Medusa with the lamp on the shield? Position it just right and it might work.
