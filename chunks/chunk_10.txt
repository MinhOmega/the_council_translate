A piece of Noah's Arc?
Not that old.
This could go on for hours, just tell me!
Caesar's laurel wreath,
Try on the crown
Stop! Don't put your grubby fat fingers on it!
You find my fingers fat?
Hahaha... at least put on some gloves.
Please note: my fingers are slim.
You were going to leave marks! My god, what an amateur!
Many harpsichord players would love to have sexy fingers like mine.
Tell me where you took your infiltration classes so I can have your tutor executed.
Let's compare hands then. We'll soon see whose fingers are fattest.
No, I'm not going to compare hands with you. Let's just keep going.
Bad loser!
Why Laurels as a symbol?
Do you know why laurel wreath are used? And not say... mistletoe or... another plant?
The laurel wreath symbolized glory in roman times.
In your opinion, what kind would suit me best?
A crown of nettles.
Mortimer thinks he's Caesar
I can just see Mortimer dressed in a toga, wearing a laurel wreath. Strutting around his manor all day long.
You have a curious idea of Mortimer.
Why? He's eccentric, like all the English are, isn't he?
Well, if Peru stands for French grace, then if I were you, I wouldn't be making that sort of remark.
Identify the object
The workmanship on this crown is amazing.
The finesse of the gold laurel leaves is beautiful.
A crown worthy of an emperor
I'd stake my life that it's the genuine article.
Say nothing
Guess what I've found.
The Holy Grail!
Older than that.

So? What do you think of our first adventure?
I must admit it has been fun by your side.
Same here.
If we'd solved the mechanism of the Medusa together, the story would have been perfect.
As Emily turned the Shield toward the dreaded Medusa, Louis rotated the knight with the sword.
A creak later, the secret door of the chimney opened.
A slight twist on what really happened won't harm future stories about our adventures.
Ooh, she's been drinking too much again.
Louis, I need to talk to you right now!
Good evening, Elizabeth.
Actually, this is not a good time...
I'm beging you, please, don't leave me alone!
I'll be waiting for you in your room but don't be late.
I was sure there was a certain je-ne-sais-quoi between us!
Louis, we need to talk now, otherwise it'll be too late!
Looks like Elizabeth really needs me, but if I start talking to her, for sure Emily won't wait for me.
What should I do?
Follow Elizabeth
Sorry, Emily, but I can't leave Elizabeth like this.
Alright, Elizabeth, how can I help?
Thank you, come on, follow me.
Join Emily
Excuse me, Elizabeth, but some very urgent business has cropped up.
We can speak tomorrow.
No, Louis! Don't leave me alone! They've come back!
Goodnight, Madam.
