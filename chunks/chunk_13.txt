Probably
Well, I must admit, Your Eminence, indeed it does worry me.
I understand, Louis. But continue to have faith in Sarah.
You'll see, I'm sure that in a few days we'll all be laughing together.
That's all I hope for, Your Eminence.
But while I have you with me, I... I have a question for you.
Go ahead, Louis. What can I do for you?
Where all eyes size you up, does that mean anything to you?
If I said to you "where all eyes size you up,‚Äù... would it mean anything to you?
Oh, I don't know if it's the place you're looking for, Louis, but it makes me think of the Portrait Gallery.
There's a Gallery here? Can you tell me where to find it, please?
Of course. Just go through the door at the end. It will lead into the library. Continue all the way through and you'll end up in the gallery.
You'll see it, Louis. When you get there, you'll know.
Thank you very much, Your Eminence.
I'm looking for a medusa.
As I haven't visited all the manor yet, I wondered if you hadn't seen a medusa by any chance?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, la... la Gorgone, the Medusa from Greek mythology. Would you have seen one? In any shape or form.
Not at all, my son. I'm not sure what you're getting at, but unfortunately I am not going to be of any use to you.
Thank you anyway, Your Eminence, I won't take up any more of your time.
Take your leave
On that last word, then I shall leave you to fight your demons.
See you later, Your Eminence.
See you later, my son.
Here's something interesting.
A manor in Maine, hundreds of acres of land in Catalonia, properties in Shanghai...
Incredible, some of these deeds are over six hundred years old. And all signed by the hand of Mortimer.
I wonder if that's what inspired my mother's attention.
How come all these documents have Mortimer's signature on them?
Do you think all these properties really belong to him?
Assume a theft
Probably, but that doesn't mean they weren't stolen.
But Mortimer's signature? It looks genuine.
Maybe he erased the original ones and signed his name instead.
Assume a falsification
These documents must be fakes. No man can own that many original works, no matter how rich he is.
Be careful. The Order has tried many times to estimate his personal wealth without ever succeeding.
And look here! Castles in Scotland, vineyards in Italy, districts in Venice! He's richer than some European countries!
Assume there are several Mortimers
Several people have played the part of Mortimer. A part that has been passed down from generation to generation.
Different men, but with one sole identity.
An intriguing hypothesis... and yet less twisted than some of my previous cases.
At last, you finally agree with me about something!
Assume Mortimer is immortal
Maybe Mortimer is immortal or capable of living for a very long time, like Methuzelah.
A first smile. Careful! Keep that up and soon you'll end up laughing!
Carry on spouting inanities like that and indeed, I might.
Analyze the documents
See those fine scratches around the words?
Yes, and?
The ink barely spreads on the paper. It spreads exactly the same way on the signature.
The deed was written using the same ink. If it is a fake, then it's a professional job.
Analyze the documents
These documents are intriguing but do you really think that's what attracted your mother's attention here?
And how do you know my mother was interested in this room?
I didn't know, I just supposed she was. And you just confirmed it. So? Do you think she found what she came for?
I don't know. She was obsessed with Mortimer and I must confess these property deeds are troubling.
If that's the case, why would she have left them?
Once again, I don't know. We'll have to ask her when we find her. And what's your take?
What do you think of this collection?
Mortimer's collection is unique, isn't it?
That's an understatement. No doubt he has a major passion for history and fine art. Or getting gifts.
If each time Mortimer does someone a favor, they reward him with a priceless gift,
... that means he must have helped nearly everybody in the world.
Why conceal these assets?
Why keep such a collection hidden in a secret room. Any thoughts?
Mortimer has every reason in the world to conceal it. Even if only to keep it from people like us.
Hey, Emily, we're not thieves. We're only looking.
How has it all been acquired?
How did Lord Mortimer get all this? It's just crazy!
Secret connections, money, or a well-kept family treasure passed on from generation to generation.
Who knows...
That would mean some of Mortimer's ancestors lived before Jesus was born.
I wonder why my mother didn't make it clear what she was interested in here.
She didn't have time to write it down or maybe she wasn't sure of what she was looking for.
Or she wanted to protect her discoveries... it's disturbing.
You'll just have to search the rest of the room. Maybe you'll find something.
