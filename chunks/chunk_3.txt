Timer Answer
Did you talk to each other?
No, she was far away, I... I didn't make any noise and then she was gone.
Have you told anyone you've seen her? Sir Holm, Mortimer?
You don't understand. It's her... she's here …  
Yes, I understand.
No, you're not listening! The moment I saw her, I was overcome by spasms!
She's here! I'm telling you it was her!
Yes, I need something to calm me down.
Just one glass
I'll drink with you, but let's go easy on it, ok?
Refuse
No thanks. I... I'd better not.
Listen, if you want me to tell you everything, you have to drink with me, Louis!
What I have to say to you is of the utmost importance!
Refuse again
I don't know where she gets her rot-gut from, but frankly, it's disgusting.
You know, Louis, when I came here, it was in the hope of getting help.
I've only just now realized that I've been drawn here into a trap.
Woah... the alcohol's... going to my head.
Here, the condemned's last drink.
I'm right behind you
Man, I... I need to take it easy with the booze. At this rate, I won't last the night.
Let's go easy on the drinking, okay? Alcohol won't solve our problems.
I'll stop here
Elizabeth, alcohol never solves anything. I'm gonna stop now.
Listen up. You want to know what your mother was capable of, right?
You want to know the reason why! Well, you're gonna have to follow me to the bottom of the abyss, Louis!
Either drink, or get out!
No, really
Errrgh, the second one isn't any easier...
So? Do you want to know why she did all those things to me, or not?!
Even if it changes the image you have of her? Forever?
What was she trying to cure you of, then?
Of the one illness she never managed to treat me for.
Together till the end!
Come on Elizabeth! We have to finish what we started!
Stop, it's too much for me
No, Elizabeth! I won't follow you.
What's the matter? Little Louis's afraid to look at the true face of his mother?
You know my rules! Drink up!
No
No, I won't drink!
Alright, Louis! Then get the hell out of here!
You're incapable of opening your eyes! So be it!
GET OUT!
I feel all... dizzy …  
There must have been a reason! Just tell me! Tell me what my mother treated you for!
She wanted to silence them!!
Wh... What? What are you talking about? Silence what?
The voices.
The voices in my head. They speak to me, Louis.
They've always told me what to do. They say nasty things to me.
Is she possessed?
Elizabeth... are you saying that... that "spirits"... talk to you?
You're right, sometimes there are several voices. How did you know?
No, listen, I... I don't know anything. I... I'm just repeating what you said.
Is she stark raving mad?
Elizabeth... do you realize what you're saying?
Of course, Louis. This is what I live every day.
But these spirits, Elizabeth, don't exist. You do realize that.
These voices in your head, it's... it's you, in fact. Nobody is speaking to you.
They want me... want me just for themselves. They talk to me all the time.
Yet your mother did everything to make them go away. Ever since I was little. And look at the result!
It's impossible, Mother! You've spend your life trying to prove that the supernatural doesn't exist... why punish this poor girl?
Oh shit... what has she done to you?
Uh oh, Louis. Are you starting to believe me?
No but... she …  
Too bad it's all been for nothing.
They're still there, you know.
What do you mean? They're still talking to you?
All the time. Despite everything Sarah put me through, I still hear them.
And here I am on a lost island, knowing that no one knows me, and I find myself here at the exact same time as her.
You see? You understand? You sense it too. I'm going to die here.
I beg you... tell me you believe me …  
Yes, I believe her
I'm here, Elizabeth. I'm right here with you, and I do believe you.
Thank you, Louis. You know, despite what people might think, I'm not crazy.
No, keep logical!
Elizabeth, I understand your fears, but I'm convinced there has to be a rational explanation for all of this.
It would just hurt you too much to believe me, wouldn't it?
No, no... but …  
So difficult to get up in the morning and realize that you're the son of a monster.
I'd rather not have met you, I...
I'd rather not have been born.
My god, Elizabeth, how is this possible?
Welcome to my world, little Louis. Welcome to my life.
Fuck, I've drunk too much... I don't feel good at all …  
Well...
Advise her to escape from the island
Elizabeth, the whole story stinks of death.
If I were you, I'd have left the moment you heard me speak about my mother.
I don't know if she knows you're here, but if I had any doubt, I wouldn't take the risk.
Yeah, you're right.
I can't stay here another minute. I need to get the hell out of here.
I need to find a boat and get away. I'm not dying here.
Oh, I feel so dizzy...
Advise her to stay here
Let's not rush into things, you have nothing to fear here, I'm with you.
And anyway, my mother's gone missing. You're not in any danger.
