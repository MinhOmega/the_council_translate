Alright, Louis! Then get the hell out of here!
You're incapable of opening your eyes! So be it!
GET OUT!
I feel all... dizzy …  
There must have been a reason! Just tell me! Tell me what my mother treated you for!
She wanted to silence them!!
Wh... What? What are you talking about? Silence what?
The voices.
The voices in my head. They speak to me, Louis.
They've always told me what to do. They say nasty things to me.
Is she possessed?
Elizabeth... are you saying that... that "spirits"... talk to you?
You're right, sometimes there are several voices. How did you know?
No, listen, I... I don't know anything. I... I'm just repeating what you said.
Is she stark raving mad?
Elizabeth... do you realize what you're saying?
Of course, Louis. This is what I live every day.
But these spirits, Elizabeth, don't exist. You do realize that.
These voices in your head, it's... it's you, in fact. Nobody is speaking to you.
They want me... want me just for themselves. They talk to me all the time.
Yet your mother did everything to make them go away. Ever since I was little. And look at the result!
It's impossible, Mother! You've spend your life trying to prove that the supernatural doesn't exist... why punish this poor girl?
Oh shit... what has she done to you?
Uh oh, Louis. Are you starting to believe me?
No but... she …  
Too bad it's all been for nothing.
They're still there, you know.
What do you mean? They're still talking to you?
All the time. Despite everything Sarah put me through, I still hear them.
And here I am on a lost island, knowing that no one knows me, and I find myself here at the exact same time as her.
You see? You understand? You sense it too. I'm going to die here.
I beg you... tell me you believe me …  
Yes, I believe her
I'm here, Elizabeth. I'm right here with you, and I do believe you.
Thank you, Louis. You know, despite what people might think, I'm not crazy.
No, keep logical!
Elizabeth, I understand your fears, but I'm convinced there has to be a rational explanation for all of this.
It would just hurt you too much to believe me, wouldn't it?
No, no... but …  
So difficult to get up in the morning and realize that you're the son of a monster.
I'd rather not have met you, I...
I'd rather not have been born.
My god, Elizabeth, how is this possible?
Welcome to my world, little Louis. Welcome to my life.
Fuck, I've drunk too much... I don't feel good at all …  
Well...
Advise her to escape from the island
Elizabeth, the whole story stinks of death.
If I were you, I'd have left the moment you heard me speak about my mother.
I don't know if she knows you're here, but if I had any doubt, I wouldn't take the risk.
Yeah, you're right.
I can't stay here another minute. I need to get the hell out of here.
I need to find a boat and get away. I'm not dying here.
Oh, I feel so dizzy...
Advise her to stay here
Let's not rush into things, you have nothing to fear here, I'm with you.
And anyway, my mother's gone missing. You're not in any danger.
That's not what the voices say.
Listen to me! Don't give up.
You must resist. And tomorrow, you'll see, things will be better.
You like my little concoction, don't you? That's rare.
What?
It no longer has any effect on me, but my guests generally don't appreciate me mixing alcohol with laudanum.
What? You... you put laudanum in my drink?
In both. Don't worry, my little Louis. We'll sink down to the bottom together.
Oh, bitch, you drugged me.
... Oh man, I feel like puking... I really feel like shit...  
I gotta... get back …  
Don't worry, Louis. I'm here now. I'll take good care of you.
And then, I'll leave.
What is this bitch gonna do to me?
Don't touch me!
If I get up, I'll fall.
... just leav …  
Oh, little Louis's tired... leave everything to me, just let go.
I really need to talk to you, Louis. Right now !
Does Lord Mortimer know the mess you've made of your room?
Listen to me, damn it! My days are numbered.
Well, Elizabeth? What was... so... urgent?
For God's sake, what's happened in here?
I really need to talk to you, Louis. Right now !
Does Lord Mortimer know the mess you've made of your room?
Listen to me, damn it! My days are numbered.
Elizabeth, I don't know if it's about my mother again, but I'm telling you, you've nothing to be afraid of.
She didn't come here for you.
Alright, what have you got on your mind now?
You've got to listen to what I have to say while there's still time.
You need to know the truth about your mother.
About my mother? Wh... what do you mean?
I saw her!
Saw who? You saw my mother?! When?
Just last night!
I went out to walk along the clifftop and I saw her, in the distance.
She tried to hide right away, but I'm sure it was her!
Analyze her behavior
Are you saying you recognized my mother in the middle of the night, while she was hiding?
Yes, Louis, I know it was her.
You just said she was far away, right? In the middle of the night. And the exterior of the island isn't exactly well lit.
Listen! I'm telling you! It was her!
She doesn't hesitate on her answers, she's not trembling. She's really convinced of what she's seen.
