What do you want to know about that night?
Ask the one in front.
How did she get past the gorgon?
How did you vanquish the medusa?
The gorgon always attacks the best protected.
The sword kills the monster, the monster charges the shield, the shield reflects the light and the lantern perturbs the monster.
I didn't need more than two minutes to solve that enigma.
That's right! Make fun of us!
Where were we both?
Before going to bed, we found ourselves in an odd situation...
You surprised me searching through Mortimer's secret gallery!
Behind the chimney. You were looking for clues about your mother.
Make her talk about the objects you found
We found ourselves in Mortimer's secret gallery.
What did we find in that room?
A load of old junk that Mortimer had collected.
A so-called Pandora's box in the form of an urn, an old sheep skin that he must take for the golden fleece...
The Bible of Judas, property deeds as old as the hills, and a broken old sword...
You are wasting your time, Louis, she already knows all that...
Of course I do, I was there!
What did she think she found behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it?
A cameo...
Why?
You know very well why!
I want you to tell me...
Why did the cameo move you?
Because I thought it was my sister's!
I was worried sick that something had happened to her and I was running through the manor looking for the bitch when...
Stop lying, Emma!
You know full well the real reason I was there was because of the Al Azif.
Liar! I was there!
I haven't even got a cameo!

What was it?
A cameo...
Why?
You know very well why!
I want you to tell me...

Liar!
I haven't even got a cameo!
Ask the the twin behind
How did you get past the gorgon?
Remember...
How did you manage to vanquish the medusa?
Sword toward the gorgon.
Gorgon toward the shield
Shield toward the sword.
Lantern toward the Shield.
Of course, I told her how to do it!
Where were we both?
In the Portrait Gallery, we found ourselves in a singular situation.
What happened to us?
We both went around the Manor all night like sleepwalkers, searching.
And that's how we found ourselves in Mortimer's Private Gallery, behind the chimney.
That doesn't prove a thing, I told you all that!
Make her talk about the objects you found
We found ourselves in Mortimer's secret gallery.
What relics did we find?
Property deeds in Mortimer's name dating from very long ago.
Is that all?
You mean all those mythological charms?
So there was the so-called Pandora's box that wasn't a box, actually.
The famous Golden Fleece that reeked of dead goat.
A broken sword that could have belonged to anyone.
Is that enough?
Yes, that's enough...
You looked captivated.
Of course, he bought it!
What did she think she would find behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it that moved you?
Nothing.
Wrong!
But I do remember picking up the first thing to hand and pretending to be the grieving sister to make you feel sorry for me.
What?...
You bitch! Liar!
What was it again?
A jewel, I think...
You dirty little...
A cameo... it was a cameo.
I made you think it reminded me of my sister's.
In truth I was looking for the Al Azif but I didn't dare tell you.
Shut your trap!
What did she think she would find behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
Now in that gallery, something moved you.
What was it that moved you?
Nothing.
Wrong!
