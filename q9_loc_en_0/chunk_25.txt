Better not take the sword with me...
All I need now is someone to accuse me of theft!

I am sorry, sir, but you're unable to access Mr Péru's room while we gather his personal effects.
My instructions are clear, Sir. No one is to enter.
Sorry, sir, but you cannot go through.
We have very clear instructions from Lord Mortimer.
Mr Péru must rest.
Mr President?
No answer...  He isn't in his room right now.
Mr President?

Louis, open up, please.
Coming, Mr President, I'm coming.
Louis! There you are at last!
Yes, I...
I just saw your mother. She was accompanied by Emily and they both went into the Duchess' room!
I tried to join them but I was refused entry!
Louis, this does not bode well...
Oh, shit... Emily might want to avenge her sister! I must act quickly!
You are right, Mr President.
Thank you!

Thank you!
Congratulations Monsieur de Richet, you made the right decision at the conference.
What can I do for you?
Speak to him about Péru's behavior.
I was wondering if you could spare me a moment.
I'd like to speak about what happened to Monsieur Péru...
And I, Monsieur, would rather not.
Frankly, I believe that he more than deserved his fate.
Don't expect me to feel sorry for him.
That's a personal remark...
You seem to have taken a personal stance.
Am I wrong?
What do you mean?
How could you possibly say something like that?
Don't insist
Ever since I found out that traces incriminating him were found next to Elizabeth's body...
You can be sure that given the opportunity, I would have put a bullet in his mouth myself!
Any news of the Al Azif?
Do you have any news regarding your search for the Al Azif?
Aha, good, you are straight to the point this time. I appreciate that.
I shall allow myself to reply only because we are now on the same side. But keep it to yourself.
My search is over. We have it!
What?
You mean you... you've found it?
Sorry, Louis. We were quicker than you.
But I can't really talk about it.
In any case, that's one good thing out of the way.
Where was it?
Congratulations, you... you were quicker than me!
Oh, don't blame yourself, you had no chance of getting the better of Sir Gregory.
Well, at least I tried.
So, tell me, where did you find it?
Would you believe that your mother gave it to Emily's twin sister before we arrived on the island.
Apparently, she asked her to hide it and once she had done so, your mother intended to kill her.
But Emma, Emily's sister, survived. Sir Gregory realized this and hid her in his apartment to tend to her without anyone knowing.
When she came around, Emma rallied to Sir Gregory and told him where the Al Azif was.
And that was it.
That's one good thing done and dusted!
Notice something
Is anything wrong?
Oh well, if I were you, Louis, I would be careful.
Emma is still alive and when your mother turns up, I wouldn't be surprised if she considers she has a score to settle with her.
You're right, it's quite probable.
I think that Sir Gregory will do all he can to calm the situation down but there's no guaranteeing that she won't find a way of taking her revenge on your mother.
However, keep it to yourself. We never spoke to each other.
(default)
Thank you for this information, sir.
Oh, don't mention it, Louis. It's natural, we are playing on the same side now.
You can always count on me.
On that note, I don't want to take up any more of your time.
Oh, not at all, Louis.
Come back whenever you want.
I'll see you later.
Leave
Excuse me, wrong room.
What do you want from me, de Richet?
Get on with it. I'm busy.
Speak to him about the conference.
I wanted to speak to you about the conference...
Listen, you chose your side.
