Well, it's one less vote for the conference.
You know my position.
I'm not gonna cry about it.
But join us, I'm sure that Sir Gregory would be delighted to have you aboard.
You never give up, do you...
You're the one who brought the subject up, Mr President.
To the great displeasure of Mortimer, apparently.
Why is that?
Well, it's one less vote at the conference.
You see, you did well in joining us.
Did you know something would happen to PÃ©ru?
Louis...
If you had known, you would have told me, wouldn't you?
No, Mr President, getting shot at wasn't part of my plans.
For once, things have turned out better than expected, so let's make the most of it.
What would you say to a cup of herbal tea?
It'll do you a world of good.
With pleasure...
Good God! They're all here...
They must have heard the gunshot...
Where is Lord Mortimer?
Can anyone hear anything through the door?

Next time I'll listen to my mother.
Not a day has gone by without something happening to me.
What now...

I'll see you later, Louis.
Damnit! It's closed!
Seems like the key is still in the lock on the other side.
That means I won't be able to pick it... 
Or, I could do as I did the last time in the Tower Room.
Use the key
I must act fast... 
Look at the gap between the door and the floor.
Slip a card underneath the door
Perfect! This card should do the trick!
Look at the gap
I wonder if I can get the key by pushing something underneath and making it fall.
Pull back the paper
Use the magnet to recover the key
Go back
Force the door open
Looks like I've got no choice, here...  Let's try brute force and ignorance!
Look at the lock
Pick the lock
Shit! The key on the other side is stopping me from unlocking the door!
Make the key fall
Slowly, Louis...  nice and slow... 
Let's have a little look at the lock 
It's not a very complex lock. I'm sure I can force it if I can just find something to smash it with.
Smash the lock with the sword
Slowly. Easy does it... 
Go back
Move away

Someone's left the key in the door... 
The key's fallen on the ground... 
Ah yes! I've got the key...

A map
Take the map
This should do the trick... 
Go back
