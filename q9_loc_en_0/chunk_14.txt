I never told you about this episode so you know nothing of what happened last night between Louis and me.
You dirty slut...
What did you do?
Ask the twin behind
What did we talk about last night?
Last night, you came to me in my room. What exactly did we talk about?
We spoke briefly about your choices during the conference, Louis.
Wh... What do you mean?
Yes, Emma, it just so happens I didn't tell you everything.
You slu...
I never told you about this part.
I HATE YOU!
Nothing, since you spurned me.
Wh... What do you mean?
Yes, Emma, as it happens, I didn't tell you everything.
You little...
See, Louis, she didn't know that we'd seen each other last night! I never told her about it.
You slut!
Last night, what were you expecting of me?
Last night, when... when you came to my room, what exactly did you expect from me ?
That, sir, is something you would have found out if you had let me stay.
But as you didn't even have a little place in your big cold bed for me, the question will remain unanswered, regretfully.
What?
You do remember that you were quite a cad.
Look, I apologise, but now at least I know who you are.
Exactly what happened.
I was hoping you would share your bed with me.
What?...
Which I did.
And it was delicious, sir.
What do you mean, it was delicious?
You little slut! What did you do?
Believe it or not, Louis, out of fear of her jealousy, I didn't tell Emma that we spent last night together.
I HATE YOU!
What did you do last night?
Describe last night, please.
Louis, it's embarrassing. You know full well what I did last night.
I want to hear you say it.
We spent it together, of course.
What?
I came to your room after the conference and excuse me if I don't go into the details but I was mightily impressed.
What did you do?
Look how you are reacting, Emma! It's not surprising I didn't tell you about my night with Louis.
You slut!
Oh, it was hardly my finest hour, now you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry but I need to know.
I came to see you to spend the rest of the night with you but you were tired and preferred to decline my invitation.
What did you do?
I know, I never spoke to you about it.
But judging by your reaction, it was just as well. And Louis did not succumb to my charms anyway.
You slut!
That's enough, both of you!
Now I know who the real Emily is!
EMILY IS OPPOSITE YOU
It's you, Emily...
No, Louis! She is manipulating you!
No, Emma. It's her, I know it.
Despite all the trouble you've gone to to put one over on me, I know it is her.
That's enough now, Emma!
You little slut!
Don't think you are going to get away with this so easily!
You are going to stop your little game right now!
Never! I am Duchess Hillsb...
No!
Emily?
I am the duchess...
But...
You don't...
I...
Dear God, what have I done?
See what you've done?
See?...
Louis?
What on earth is...
Mother!
Go away!
You must go! Everyone is going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Come on, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I am coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
EMILY IS BEHIND YOU
You are Emily Hillsborrow.
I knew you wouldn't get it wrong, Louis.
No! You little bitch!
Watch out, Louis!
No!!
Hell, what have I done?
See what you've done?
