See?
Louis?
What on earth is going...
Mother!
Go!
You must leave! Everyone's going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Go! Go, Mother!
No one must find you here!
Go!
Come, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I'm coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
What? What are you doing there?
Stop!
Goddammit! Now what's going on?
I do believe that's Emily's voice...
Listen at the door
I can't understand what she's saying !
Knock at the door
Emily! Emily, are you there?...  Answer me!...  Emily?
Try to open the door
Try to pick the lock.
I can't open it...  It must be blocked on the other side! I'll have to find another way in quick!
Try to force open the door.
Impossible!   I can't do it, there's something blocking it on the other side!   I've got to find another way in!
Go back
Move away

Did you hear that, I was not dreaming, was I?
Certainly not, Duke Godoy.
What's going on?
Someone heard a bang coming from the Duchess' room and she isn't answering.
Gentlemen, go back to your rooms.
Go back to...
your...
rooms!
I shall find out from Lord Mortimer what this is all about...
Thank you...
Knock at the door
No answer... 
Insist
Nothing... 
Insist again
Emily?
Emily, are you there?
Leave it
Knock at the door

Emily?
Emily, are you there?
Leave it
Emily...
Yes...  Louis, is that you?
Yes, let me in...
I...
I'm sorry, Louis...
I don't feel very well. I'll see you later...
Are you sure everything's all right?
...
Are you still there?
How could you do that to me?
You're a fine one to talk! Once again, you're the one who's the victim in all this!
What are you on about now?
I should never have told you what happened to me!
That's how it works and you know it full well! I'm not that naive!
I know you inside out!
Stop! We'll end up losing everything if you keep on!
It's as if there are several people inside... 
It's as if there are several people inside... 
My friends...
I don't understand... I spoke to him only recently...
Monsieur PÃ©ru has lost his mind, it's obvious!
Yet another way for the French to make a spectacle of themselves! Well, once again, it has worked!
My friends, let us settle down, please...
