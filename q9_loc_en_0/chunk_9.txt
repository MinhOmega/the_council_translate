I know, I never spoke to you about it.
But judging by your reaction, it was just as well. And Louis did not succumb to my charms anyway.
You slut!
That's enough, both of you!
Now I know who the real Emily is!
EMILY IS OPPOSITE YOU
It's you, Emily...
No, Louis! She is manipulating you!
No, Emma. It's her, I know it.
Despite all the trouble you've gone to to put one over on me, I know it is her.
That's enough now, Emma!
You little slut!
Don't think you are going to get away with this so easily!
You are going to stop your little game right now!
Never! I am Duchess Hillsb...
No!
Emily?
I am the duchess...
But...
You don't...
I...
Dear God, what have I done?
See what you've done?
See?...
Louis?
What on earth is...
Mother!
Go away!
You must go! Everyone is going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Come on, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I am coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
EMILY IS BEHIND YOU
You are Emily Hillsborrow.
I knew you wouldn't get it wrong, Louis.
No! You little bitch!
Watch out, Louis!
No!!
Hell, what have I done?
See what you've done?
See?
Louis?
What on earth is going...
Mother!
Go!
You must leave! Everyone's going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Go! Go, Mother!
No one must find you here!
Go!
Come, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I'm coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
What? What are you doing there?
Stop!
Goddammit! Now what's going on?
What on earth is...
You...
Mother?
How dare you do this to me?
You can talk!
After everything I've done for you!
You are joking, I hope, right?
I gave you my life!
That's enough, Emma!
Now that Louis is here, you will leave Sarah alone!
Cease your revenge immediately!
Wh... What?
If you think you're going to...
Louis!! Help me, I beg you, I can no longer reason with her.
I am Emily! Quit playing games!
I... What?
Honestly, don't be ridiculous!
No, I am Emily! You are wasting your time, Louis knows very well how to tell us apart.
After everything we've been through together!
Yes... well...
Don't you dare bring him into this, this is between you and me!
