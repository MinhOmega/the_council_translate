Try to force open the window
No way...  it's too sturdy... 
Go back
I have to get inside Emily's room through the... 
Shit, it's locked!
Pick the lock
Force open the window

Speak to him
Monsieur Péru?
...  (inaudible)
Monsieur?
...  (inaudible)
Oh man...  I don't know what Mortimer has given him but he's not looking all there.
Examine him
He is in a catatonic state.
Observe him
I wonder what can have done this to him...
I know Lord Mortimer gave him something but even the strongest opiates don't have this effect.
It's as if his body is no longer responding.
Check him over
Pupils totally dilated and unresponsive.
Pulse extremely slow and faint.
No reaction to any stimuli. It's the first time I've come across something like this.
I don't even know how he is able to stay seated.
Analyze him
I've seen patients after a major trauma before but, but nothing like this.
Mortimer has spared no effort to "calm" him down.
Go back
Search his pockets
Let's see what he has on him...
Leave him

Excuse me, my son, but I would like a few moments to gather my thoughts.
We shall perhaps meet later...
Your Eminence...
Ah, Louis!
Well done, my son!
You may well have saved our lives. Who knows what that madman was capable of?
It was a reflex reaction.
And modest as well.
Sarah would be proud of you.
You were admirable...
You didn't manage to save Péru but whatever you do, don't blame yourself. You did your best.
I...  Thank you, your Eminence.
What a disturbing turn of events!
What just happened is terrible. Who could have guessed that Monsieur Péru was in such a bad way?
No one, your Eminence.
No one...
Ah...It's not going to help matters for Mortimer. Now he has one less vote for the conference.
He doesn't look too put out, though
You don't seem too affected by it, though.
Louis, I do not appreciate your remark, which I will put down to the indiscretions of youth.
I am here in the interests of the Holy Seat, but I am above all a christian and it hurts me to see lost souls take a wrong turn.
Of course, of course...
The bugger hasn't lost sight of his interests
Ah! I see his Eminence is able to identify a good opportunity in every situation.
Now what do you expect, Louis?
The benefit of age. You'll see, you'll learn with time.
Except if I find it disgusting...
Indeed, a tough blow for Mortimer.
What do you expect?
Mortimer has chosen his supporters.
Maybe he should have chosen more carefully.
But even with such a setback, I'd still be wary of Mortimer.
I sense he has still a few surprises in store for us.
Oh, I fully agree with you.
I learned about your failure with Washington.
I did my best. The President is a shrewd diplomat.
It was perhaps too early to send you to the front line of the battle.
Mah, don't blame yourself.
Anyway, I am tired.
If you don't mind, I shall retire to my bed.
By all means, your Eminence.
I've been told about Washington.
