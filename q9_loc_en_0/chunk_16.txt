We are all in shock, of course...
Let us praise Louis' gesture anyway...
You did what you could...
Yes, it was very noble of you, Louis.
It wasn't your fault...
There was nothing else you could have done...
Let us celebrate Louis' courage, he enabled us to avert a tragedy!
Yes, that was very noble of you, Louis.
You have given us all a fine lesson in courage!
I... Thank you...
He owes you his life, that's quite something!
That madman deserves to die!
We are providing Monsieur Péru with care, but rest assured, he's no longer a danger to himself, or anyone else for that matter.
It's absolutely incomprehensible...
As you say...
No idea what he could have blamed himself for, but the poor man was literally racked with remorse.
What a pity he did not seek the mercy of the Lord...
He is forever damned, now...
I think everyone needs a little rest...
Can you stay a moment?
Of course...
Louis?
Louis? Are you awake?
Ah! It looks like he's coming around...
You gave us a mighty fright, sir.
A veritable force of nature!
It's hard to believe, isn't it...
That's Sarah's boy all right.
Slowly, Louis. Take your time.
I... Mr President?...
I... I've got... I've got a bad...
Careful, you haven't fully recovered...
You've had rather a close call Louis!
We're all relieved to see you back with us...
My friends, this is a great relief to us all..
But please, let Louis recover now...
Monsieur de Richet, we have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but I hope you will soon be back on your feet so we can rectify that.
Allow me to introduce myself...
Manuel Godoy, Duke of Alcudia and Head of the Spanish government.
Godoy... He... he's the one Mother spoke about giving a present to in her letter. The one found on the wharf.
Very... Very honored, sir...
Now, let us leave him to rest.
See you later. Get some rest.
Louis?
Louis? Are you awake?
Ah! It looks like he's coming around...
You gave us a mighty fright, sir.
A veritable force of nature!
It's hard to believe, isn't it...
That's Sarah's boy all right.
Slowly, Louis. Take your time.
I... Mr President?...
I... I've got... I've got a bad...
Careful, you haven't fully recovered...
You've had rather a close call Louis!
We're all relieved to see you back with us...
My friends, this is a great relief to us all..

Very... Very honored, sir...
Now, let us leave him to rest.
See you later. Get some rest.
Oh Louis!...  one more thing, please.
I wanted to thank you for your support during the conference.
You've made the right choice and it gives me tremendous satisfaction to have you with me on this project.
It's worth it
What is at stake is worth it, my Lord.
Now I won't hide from you the fact that I have no idea by what miracle we could ever get a unanimous vote.
We shall lose
And much good may it do you, my Lord.
But look at the voters. It needs to be unanimous.
And we just lost Péru.
The battle is already lost, if you ask me.
Trust me, Louis.
We still have a few more cards to play, you'll see.
Anything can happen in politics.
What a pity you didn't support me during the conference.
I hope I can count on you on the day of the vote.
This major project needs men like you, Louis!
Thank you, but no
I am flattered, my Lord, but I don't know what could possibly make me change my mind.
Please, don't refuse me my last hope... 
Don't mix hope with illusion, my Lord.
And you, illusion with strategy, my friend.
You win, I'll let you have the last word.
I'll think about it
And you never know, right?...  Maybe by then I'll see things differently.
Well, thank you for allowing me to believe in that possibility, Louis.
From here on, I shall make it my mission to persuade you to change your vote.
Be my guest.
But I hope your arguments are very very persuasive, because I'm not the only one who isn't on your side.
Oh, rest assured. I am working on it!
Very well, then.
I'll see you later, my Lord.
Louis, I wanted to thank you personally.
I admire what you did to save Monsieur Péru's life.
You have given us all a wonderful lesson in courage.
