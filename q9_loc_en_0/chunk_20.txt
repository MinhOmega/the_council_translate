The day you arrived on the island, your mother apparently shot Emma.
What?...
What on earth is this all about?
I'd better warn you: the reasons are very obscure but Sir Gregory witnessed the scene.
My vision was real then! I had it at the same time as the altercation!
What's... what's happening here, Mr President?
How long exactly have I been bedridden?
For nearly two days... We started the conference without you or Sarah, of course...
What do you mean?
Say nothing
Yes... Lord Mortimer brought us together in his usual fashion to propose that we partake in a major project.
This time he and Sir Gregory were against each other over the fate of Louisiana: Lord Mortimer wanted Spain to cede it to France.
The ultimate aim being to double the territory of the United States, so creating the biggest democratic state in the world!
Just think of the shear scope of the idea, Louis!
I... yes... but I... I guess I didn't realize that decisions like that were made in this way.
As your mother supported Lord Mortimer, you were announced as her substitute, on Lord Mortimer's side for the time being.
You'll be able to position yourself as you please within the next two days, the final vote won't be held before that.
If... if only I had anticipated this...
All of this in only two days... you haven't been idle, that's for sure...
Poor Elizabeth... I... I still don't understand...
Yes, I share your feelings.
And I still don't know how I'm going to tell her father.
Thank you for all the information, Mr President.
You're welcome, Louis.
I'll get you a nice cup of herbal tea, it'll do you good.
I'll see you shortly...
We thought that bastard Péru had taken you out as well.
Me too?
What do you mean by "me as well"?
Péru is the one who assassinated Miss Adams.
We found his footprint at the scene of the crime.
What do you mean?
What? He's the one who shot at me?
Yes, indeed. At point blank range!
It's a miracle you survived.
The scoundrel tried to pass your murder off as the result of your meeting with Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory.
It seemed like things hadn't gone very well for you...So, that sly fox tried to make Mortimer believe that he thought the sentence was death anyway.
Thankfully, Mortimer is not an easy man to fool.
Elizabeth, she...
It's... it's over, Louis.
Get your strength back...
Has my mother reappeared?
Alas, no... I'm sorry.
But I've been doing a little investigating while you were recovering...
What do you mean?
Say nothing
I've found out that your mother kept in touch with Emily's twin sister, Emma, who was on the island before we arrived.
Between them, they have hidden a book on the island...
Emily and her... her sister were twins?...
Yes, they share the same identity, very handy for a spy.
But keep it to yourself, it's their most closely guarded secret and for Emily it's no joking matter.
Well, Emily must have been pleased to be with her sister, though.
Unfortunately not.
I hadn't finished.

I'll see you shortly...
Slowly now...
It's a miracle that you are still alive, so let's not force it...
Yes... don't worry...
The bastard really let me have it...
You have given us a fine lesson in courage, Louis.
Can't say it's done you much good...but still, not everyone would have done it.
What...what's happened to Péru?
He has withdrawn into silence.
Lord Mortimer gave him something to calm him down and let's just say it was a healthy dose.
He is locked in his room in a nearly catatonic state.
We can't exactly say it's good for our business, Louis.
What do you mean?
We just lost a vote for Mortimer's cause at the conference...
I must admit that's not the first thing that came into my mind.
Don't get me wrong... It's not that I am indifferent to Péru's personal tragedy.
But I simply can't forget the interests of my Nation.
All is not lost... I have faith that Mortimer will find a solution.
And I'm certain it won't be long before he lets us know what it is...
Of course Mortimer is less than happy about it.
...meaning?
