Congratulations, Louis. I must admit, though, when I first saw you, I would never have put money on you succeeding.
Well, I was wrong!
Thank you, your Eminence.
On that note, I shall leave you, Louis.
I'll see you later.
I hope that Monsieur Péru's act will help you reconsider your choice, Louis...  sincerely.
See where his support for Lord Mortimer got him...
Mock him over Godoy
As for you, your Eminence, I'd advise you to be wary of your allies.
Come, Louis, I am past the age of being influenced by simple posturing.
I am tired now, let us resume our discussion later, if you don't mind.
As you please, your Eminence...
Beware of Godoy
Godoy betrayed you.
He has turned his back on you and will follow Mortimer.
What? Are you joking?
You can always join us, your Eminence.
Don't be the butt of the joke.
When all your so-called allies have changed sides without warning, you'll be a laughing stock...
I don't know what you are talking about, Louis.
Please excuse me, but I am tired, we shall resume our discussion later perhaps...
As you please, your Eminence...
Say nothing
And what will your mother say when she finds out that you have triggered a war with your amateur diplomacy.
This cannot be serious, really.
Thank you for your advice, your Eminence...
Think nothing of it, Louis.
See you later.
Your Eminence...
Ah, Louis!
Well done, my son!
You may well have saved our lives. Who knows what that madman was capable of?
It was a reflex reaction.
And modest as well.
Sarah would be proud of you.
You were admirable...
You didn't manage to save Péru but whatever you do, don't blame yourself. You did your best.
I...  Thank you, your Eminence.
What a disturbing turn of events!
What just happened is terrible. Who could have guessed that Monsieur Péru was in such a bad way?
No one, your Eminence.
No one...
Ah...It's not going to help matters for Mortimer. Now he has one less vote for the conference.
He doesn't look too put out, though
You don't seem too affected by it, though.
Louis, I do not appreciate your remark, which I will put down to the indiscretions of youth.
I am here in the interests of the Holy Seat, but I am above all a christian and it hurts me to see lost souls take a wrong turn.
Of course, of course...
The bugger hasn't lost sight of his interests
Ah! I see his Eminence is able to identify a good opportunity in every situation.
Now what do you expect, Louis?
The benefit of age. You'll see, you'll learn with time.
Except if I find it disgusting...
Indeed, a tough blow for Mortimer.
What do you expect?
Mortimer has chosen his supporters.
Maybe he should have chosen more carefully.
But even with such a setback, I'd still be wary of Mortimer.
I sense he has still a few surprises in store for us.
Oh, I fully agree with you.
I learned about your failure with Washington.
I did my best. The President is a shrewd diplomat.
It was perhaps too early to send you to the front line of the battle.
Mah, don't blame yourself.
Anyway, I am tired.
If you don't mind, I shall retire to my bed.
By all means, your Eminence.
I've been told about Washington.
Congratulations, Louis. I must admit, though, when I first saw you, I would never have put money on you succeeding.

Better not take the sword with me... 
All I need now is someone to accuse me of theft!
