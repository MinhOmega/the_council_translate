I ask for nothing more! So stop taking it out on Sarah!
I...
You prissy little bitch! How dare you!
Now that I've told you everything, you want to take my place, do you?
You are joking, I hope! I'm the one who told you everything that's been going on while you were away!
Go on then! That's what you want, isn't it?
You want to kill me! Go on then, shoot!
After all the trouble I've gone through to find you? Go on! What are you waiting for?
Here, Louis, take this!
Wait, what's going...
An entire life for this! Go on! Shoot!
Sorry, Louis. I can't shoot her, she's my sister...
I...
That's enough, Emma!
Louis, out of the way! She's dangerous, don't trust her!
What are you trying to do?
Louis, out of the way!
I AM NOT EMMA!
Come on, Louis, tell her who the real Emily is...
Wait, I...
That's right, Louis!
I'm fed up with this little game! Tell him who the real Emily is!
Why do these things always happen to me?...
Well?
Louis, come on, you know how to tell us apart, right?!
Yes, yes but I'd like to ask you a few questions, to make sure there is no doubt.
Rational and open, Louis...
Let's see, how can I tell them apart?
Wait, I've got an idea...
On the night of our arrival...
Ask the twin in front
Who was with us?
Who was with us on the wharf?
Cardinal Piaggi.
He was with us from when we started traveling by ship. We arrived on the same boat.
I already told her, Louis...
Another question then?
I'm the one who told you!
What is my job?
You had asked me what had become of me since we last met in London some years before.
What did I answer?
You are an Occultist, Louis.
You told me what happened to you at Hexham Abbey.
That you are a detective, Louis.
You even told me about your adventures regarding some news item...
What were they called now?...
Ah yes! The Chauffeurs d'Orgères!
That you are a Diplomat, Louis.
You even told me about the troubles you had saving some compatriots during the French Revolution.
I already told her, Louis...
I was there!
What happened to me?
On the wharf, something happened to me. What was it?
A malaise. The moment you arrived you felt ill.
And I offered to help while Piaggi went up.
And you turned me down flat.
What did you give me?
You gave me something.
I wasn't feeling very well and you gave me something!
What was it?
My handkerchief...
And you even kept it! It was stained with your blood.
Louis, I already told her. This is all a waste of time...
I'm the one who told YOU!
Ask the twin behind
Who was with us?
Who was with us on the wharf?
Cardinal Piaggi, who couldn't stop talking.
Louis, I already told her about our arrival...
I know because I was there!
The cardinal went up, you felt poorly, Louis, and I offered you my handkerchief!
I was there!
What is my job?
You asked me what had become of me since we last met in London, many years ago.
What did I answer?
You told me that you had become an occultist, Louis.
You know that because I told you!
You even told me about your setbacks at Hexham Abbey, remember?
You told me you had become a Detective, Louis.
You only know that because I told you!
You even told me about your exploits with the thieves who tortured their victims.
What were they called again?...
The Chauffeurs d'Orgères, I think...
You told me you had become a Diplomat, Louis.
You know that because I told you!
Remember, you told me about the difficulty you had saving some British compatriots during the revolution.
I was the one who told you that!
Liar! I was there!
What happened to me?
On the wharf, something happened to me. What happened exactly?
You felt unwell, you had a nose bleed.
And I offered you my handkerchief...
I told her all that already...
It was me who told you!
What did you give me?
You handed me something.
I wasn't feeling very well and you handed me something!
What was it?
My handkerchief...
...and you stained it with your blood.
