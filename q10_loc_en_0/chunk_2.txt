This is like a bad dream...
Do you realize the impact it's going to have, once we get back home?
You understand we are not here to play games?
Mortimer should never have brought you to our table!
What about him, he declared war on me!!
Oh there's no need to get on your high horse!
We have both had our share of little surprises!
You did not warn me that you were going to declare war, now did you!?
Yes...  no but...  I...
No one could have predicted that Péru would react like that.
Now what's done is done.
It makes no difference to us!
Reassure him
Come now, my Lord Duke, you know very well that at this level things can get pretty rough.
You ought to be used to it.
Rest assured, Lord Mortimer has bounced back before.
It is not an issue.
Monsieur de Richet! I've found this conference at times quite amusing...
Excuse this public humiliation but I think you'll have learned your lesson...
No hard feelings?
As for you...  you lose nothing by waiting!!!
Naturally. It's part of the job, you can't win them all.
Ah, de Richet, congratulations for your efforts with Washington...
I see that Sir Gregory did well to trust you.
Ah, de Richet...
Nice try with George Washington...
You are still a little raw to be able to manipulate an old wolf like him but what could be expected? So don't blame yourself.
You think you could have handled it?
Certainly...
Monsieur de Richet, you are up at last...
I am happy to see it...
Thank you for your concern...
Lord Mortimer speaks very highly of you...
Even though you are not on our side at the conference, I would be inclined to agree with him...
Have you thought it over? I mean, is your choice final?
Technically speaking, I haven't made my choice yet.
Everyone thinks I'm on Mortimer's side... why not, but as I wasn't present for your initial meetings, the truth is, I haven't committed to anything for the moment.
Good news! Sir Gregory will be pleased!!
What can I do for you?
I'm dreaming...
My mother was right, he‘s not going to tell me one word about what happened to Emily.
To tell you the truth, I'm in search of an armillary sphere. You wouldn't know where I can find it, would you?
Well, well...  so you too have a passion for astronomy?
Von Wöllner has already bored me quite enough with all of his endless stories...
You ought to concentrate, Louis. Politics is an art that requires all ones attention. Refrain from spreading yourself too thin and leave stargazing to the poets.
What can I say, I am only...
Ask Wöllner, I am sure he must have it among his effects.
Perfect.
Thank you, my Lord Duke.
Leave me now.
See you later.
Go away!
Goddammit de Richet!
Are you joking or what? You sell me pipe dreams about Mortimer's project and a few hours later, one of your allies completely breaks down.
Is this what Mortimer's side is all about?
What am I going to do now?
He's got a point there
I admit that things haven't gone exactly as I intended, my Lord Duke.
This is like a bad dream...
