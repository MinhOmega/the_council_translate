Leave
I should have learned my lessons in card reading a little better.
A hand of tarot cards.
Read the hand.
The Emperor, symbol of power and stability.
Temperance which expresses a reward.
And the Chariot... that evokes triumph.
If this hand is anything to go by, Mortimer's destiny promises to be glorious..
Leave
I should have learned my lessons in card reading a little better.
Ah, Louis! Glad you are here!
Blast it, he's going to talk about my mother...
Come and see what I've found!
There are pieces of paper in the ashes of the chimney. Someone's been burning something here...
Incredible... he doesn't seem to want to speak to me about what happened between my mother and the Hillsborrow sisters...
Show me a little...
Look! It's possible to distinguish two different writing styles!
The rest of the correspondence between my mother and Emma...
Someone tried to burn an exchange of messages! I am certain!
There must be more...
Shit... what on earth is he doing?...
Diversion
Ah, I see...
I know what it's about!
Do you know who was doing their communicating in this room?
Yes... But of course we must keep it to ourselves, because it is still a sensitive matter...
Wöllner and Elizabeth had an affair...
Wöllner hinted that he'd found a way to remain discreet about it.
I admit, it is ingenious...
Well, I would never have guessed...
Delighted to have helped, but I still have to find my mother...
Of course... We shall see each other later in that case...
Manipulate
If you want my opinion, a servant must have burnt some old papers, that's all...
Why, of course!
You very nearly made me think that you were trying to hide something, Louis...
No, I'm sure there must be other hidden messages!
Tell the truth
There were...
Pardon?
There were more... Emma and my mother communicated through messages in this room.
I found their correspondence and I preferred to burn it all so as not to leave any traces.
But, why didn't you say so?
That's what I'm doing now, Mr President.
Before, well, it all seemed unimportant compared to everything that had happened.
I... yes, you are right.
Moreover, we ought to lend a helping hand...
I shall have a word with Lord Mortimer, because the conference must not make us forget about Sarah.
No! No, thank you, no, I certainly don't want Mortimer giving me any more attention than he is at the moment...
Thank you. Thank you, Mr President.
If you don't mind, I'll take care of it.
As you wish.
Keep persevering. I shall see you later.
Wasted enough time, the Bible!
He won't let go! He's going to work his way back to the Bible if he continues...
