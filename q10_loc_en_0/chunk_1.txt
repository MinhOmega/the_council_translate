Right, it's definitely an armillary sphere, but I'll have to find one that I can take with me, otherwise I risk drawing too much attention to my comings and goings.
Now, where can I find a smaller one?... 
Given the size of that armillary sphere, I'm really glad I've found a smaller one.

Goat skulls...  Chicken legs... 
Mortimer is interested in black magic.
If Mortimer really is a Demon, I wonder what he can be doing with all this...

How does it work, now?
Ask my mother how it works?
Tell me, Mother, you wouldn't know anything that might save me some time, would you?
That's where you'll have to put the Clement III cross.
You insert the cross into the slot and it will open the iris.
But don't do it straightaway. Start by gathering everything together first, because you've seen what happens when you try to go too fast.
Analyze by myself
Let's see if I can work it out myself.
Looks like a kind of control panel.
There's a cross-shaped slot there.

I'd say you've got to to place the Clement III cross in it.
Looks like... 
It looks like certain mechanisms I've seen before.
I wouldn't be surprised if I had to put the Clement III cross in it.
Go back
Leave
You ought to go, Louis.
If someone finds us here, the situation might well become seriously complicated.

I'd say it's onyx or...  obsidian... 
I don't know what's written. I don't recognize the engraved symbols at all.
What on earth is that?... 
Looks like obsidian or...  or onyx. It must weigh a ton...

It's locked.
So that's the Exegesis of Judas... 
I hope Mortimer doesn't read it very often, otherwise he's going to notice that someone's stolen it.
But that's just too bad, I need it.

Goddammit de Richet!
Are you joking or what? You sell me pipe dreams about Mortimer's project and a few hours later, one of your allies completely breaks down.
Is this what Mortimer's side is all about?
What am I going to do now?
He's got a point there
I admit that things haven't gone exactly as I intended, my Lord Duke.
