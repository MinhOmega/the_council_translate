The cross is stuck in the mechanism...  I can't do anything.
It looks like I can move it now!
Turn the wheel of the icons
Analyse the wheels
Let's see what combination corresponds to the chosen theme.
Guess the right date
By following the clues in the Bibles and the architect's notes...
The resurrection took place on the 14th of Nissan 3793 according to the astronomers of that time. That would correspond to April 1st in the year 33 on a modern calendar.
The crucifixion took place on the 8th of Nisan 3793 according to the astronomers of that time. That would correspond to March 26th in the year 33 on a modern calendar.
Guess the right moon
According to the architect's notes and the armillary sphere...
The moon during the resurrection was a waxing gibbous. That's the one on which the shadow on the right is just a small crescent.
The moon during the Crucifixion was a first quarter. That's the one with its left half in the light.
Guess the right icon
To follow the resurrection theme, I should select the halo.
To follow the crucifixion theme, I should select the Crown of thorns.

What on earth is that?
A disk with information engraved in the metal.
An iris that should open, I imagine.
And blood...
Speak about the outer disk
There are Roman numbers, Arab numbers and town names.
Go on, I am listening.
What do you think ?
Think about the names of the towns
All the towns mentioned have something to do with Christ, haven't they?
Golgotha, Bethlehem, Nazareth...
Exactly.
Analyze the mechanism
Tell me, I imagine that once we've solved this enigma, the iris opens, right?
Exactly.
Make the connection with the nails
How many nails are needed again?
Three.
One nail per type of information, I'm guessing.
In other words?
Well, a nail must be placed on a Roman numeral, one nail on an Arabic numeral and one nail on a town.
Well done, Louis.
There are some holes
On each engraved piece of information, there is a hole.
Those are for the nails, right?
That's absolutely right.
Nothing
Frankly? Not much.
It's not going to be easy.
So start by fetching all the keys, then.
Go back
Speak about the iris
Did you succeed in opening the iris?
Yes, by putting the cross on the console and the three nails on the disk, the iris opens.
It gives access to a hole where I put my hand, thinking I could fully open the iris.
There's a handle at the bottom. And as you can see, it didn't turn out very well for me.
Speak about the blood
Mother? The dried blood, there...
Yes, yes... It's mine...
Sorry if I stained everything but I must admit that, at the time, my thoughts were more on the pain than cleaning up after myself.
Leave
I don't want to hurry you but perhaps it's time you left, Louis.
I'm going, I'm going...
Louis, stop playing with that door. Hurry up and go fetch all the keys.
What on earth is that?
A disk with information engraved in the metal.
An iris that should open, I imagine.
And blood...
