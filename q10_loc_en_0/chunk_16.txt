Analyze the wheel of the icons
There are different icons on this wheel. But it looks like some of them can't be connected to the other wheels.
Recognize the icons
I think I can make out each one of the icons apart from the one covered in blood...
Going clockwise from the one I just mentioned, we have the halo that represents the RESURECTION...
The waves represent the BAPTISM of Jesus.
It's more difficult to identify the next one...  Maybe a crib and in that case it's surely linked to the BIRTH of Christ...  The red herring that my mother followed...
Then, a symbol represents the crown of thorns, that Jesus wore during his CRUCIFIXION.
The dove also represents the BAPTISM...  Certainly another red herring.
Then comes the symbol of the TRINITY.
And finally, the candle that must stand for the LAST SUPPER.
Analyze the number of icons
Now, given the difference between the number of icons and the number of towns, I think that only one path connects all the wheels with one another...
Let's try to connect the theme I've chosen with the rest.
Ask advice from Sarah
Mother, what do you think?
As I told you, I didn't get that far...
Nevertheless, these icons do represent moments in the life of Christ.

Analyze the wheel of the dates
This wheel contains several symbols made up of one or two figures, and one letter.
Deduce what it stands for
The highest figure does not exceed 31 and each letter corresponds to a month of the year: A for April, M for March...
I think these symbols must represent a specific date.

Analyze the wheel of the moons
This wheel represents the different moons.
Analyze the moons
The totally black moon corresponds to the new moon. So, going clockwise, we have:
The waning crescent
The last quarter
The waning gibbous
The full moon
The waxing gibbous
The first quarter
And lastly, the waxing crescent
The North is indicated for each of them. So, if the shadow goes from west to east, it means it is progressing from left to right...
Symbols of the moons
In the occult sciences, we represent the full moon by an X. As for the DARK moon, called the NEW MOON, in cults it's often associated with something harmful.

Look at the mechanism
Look at this! There are notches between each of the wheels!
So I have to link the name of the town from the theme I've chosen to an icon, then to a date, and finally the date to the moon...

The cycle of the moons has nothing to do with what I'm doing right now...
Study the sphere
During New Moon, the moon is entirely in the shadow. Then, the shadow moves from West to East, meaning Left to Right, and goes through the following states:
Waxing crescent, First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full moon, Waning gibbous, Last quarter, Waning crescent, and the cycle starts over with the full shadowed New Moon.
Focus on the moon
The moon shadow moves from West to East.
