I am sure that you are aware that this is the cross that Lord Mortimer gave to me when we first met.
That was the day I decided to take the cloth.
It cannot be a coincidence.
Please, I beg you...  why the cross of Pope Clement?
For no reason
Why not?
Believe me, I have no particular reason.
You are lying, Louis.
How do you expect me to trust you?
No, I'm sorry, try something else! Like the truth, perhaps!
To open a gigantic door
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me...
Come, please try, my son.
The cross can help me activate a mechanism that will open a gigantic door hidden in the crypt of the manor...
... with the help of the Exegesis of Judas, the Gutenberg Bible, and some nails.
Indeed...
I trusted you, but enough is enough, Louis!
I do not appreciate being taken for a fool!
I would therefore appreciate it if you would change your tune this very instant!
To stave off evil.
Your Eminence, I sense that evil is rampant in these parts.
Help me, I need protection. Please, let me have the cross.
I beseech you!
Of course, my son. Do not fear, it will give you protection.
Never will I leave a true believer in such depravity.
To pray for my mother
I would like to pray for my mother.
She seems more than ever to need prayers from those who love her.
I am afraid of losing her to her demons, your Eminence.
I won't hide the fact that I am not reassured about her either.
Of course I shall let you have my cross.
Good Outcome
Louis, thank you for trusting me. I shall not forget it.
You can take my cross, here.
But please return it to me once you have finished with it.
Thank you, thank you, your Eminence.
You are a lifesaver.
Bad Outcome
I regret to tell you that I am unable to grant your request. The answer is no.
But fear not, I shall not abandon you.
You seem to be taking the same dark path as Sarah took here. And I know what the outcome will be.
You must leave me now, but remember that I am not abandoning you. I just need a little more time.
Trust me. I will get you out of there.
Just be strong, Louis!
"Weaknesses of the Human Psyche" by Guihem Trimmoer.
"It is possible to drill an idea into someone by constant daily repetition, until the mind gives in".
"Guilhem Trimmoer"... 
 Trimmoer...  an anagram of Mortimer.
Wow... arrogant enough to publish writings on mental control in full view of everyone.
I wonder who he is writing for?
