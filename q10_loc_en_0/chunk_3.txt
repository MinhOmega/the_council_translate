Well, well...  so you too have a passion for astronomy?
Von Wöllner has already bored me quite enough with all of his endless stories...
You ought to concentrate, Louis. Politics is an art that requires all ones attention. Refrain from spreading yourself too thin and leave stargazing to the poets.
What can I say, I am only...
Ask Wöllner, I am sure he must have it among his effects.
Perfect.
Thank you, my Lord Duke.
Leave me now.
See you later.
Go away!
So? Good, you've managed to gather all the keys?
Yes, that's right, I have everything.
What should I start with?
Place the Clement III cross on the console.
Then, you have to put the nails on the disk of the door.
Where to put the nails?
What hole should I put the nails in?
Well,  I can't really advise you there, because I haven't exactly made the best choices myself.
All I can say is that you have to insert:
One to choose a town.
One to choose a chapter.
And one to choose a verse.
Ask her what she chose
What theme did you start with?
As the fresco shows the birth of Christ, I placed one nail in Bethlehem, one in Chapter II and one in Verse 6.
The iris opened a little. I thought it was normal.
Behind the aperture of the iris, there is a duct in which I put my hand. I felt something like a valve at the bottom.
I thought by turning it the door would open, or the iris would open completely, or something else would happen.
Instead, I felt something like an ax cut off my hand.
I really thought it was the end of me.
What did you do then?
Well, although I had made some unfortunate choices, I was lucky in that Mortimer was well stocked with drugs.
I raided his supplies of medicine.
I can begin
Alright, my turn now.
Go ahead, impress me. I'll shut up and let you concentrate.

Who could Mortimer have locked in there?

So that's Pandora's box? An urn?... 
Mother seemed worried that I was able to open it...  I wonder why.
So, I did well not to touch it.
Never mind, now it's too late...

I wonder how long has this been in here?

Caesar's laurel wreath... hmmm.
If Mortimer really is what my mother says he is, it could mean... 
No, that's impossible. No, no, no...  not Cesar...

Right...  I'll have to find the one my mother lost...  But where do I begin?

A map of the triangular trade...  organized by a Demon... 
it makes me want to throw up.
If Mortimer really is what my mother says he is, this map of the world's slave traffic is even worse than I thought.

A map of the Orient... 
The conference might be focused on the United States, but Mortimer has an eye everywhere.
Which is not very reassuring, if he really is a Demon.

The map of Europe.
Someone's written 26 million, in France.
Analyse
It's the estimated population of France.
Mortimer knows very well that France has a higher population than its neighbors.
He is preparing for it to go to war and knows he can make it happen by stirring up the people.
I'm standing in front of a lesson of absolute mastery in military strategy.
Which is absolutely spine-chilling if it turns out that Mortimer is a Demon.

Troops are directed towards Italy.
I get the feeling that Piaggi is going to be in for a hard time.
Mortimer has been planning to invade Italy for a long time.
Yet he seems to be establishing strongholds lined up against Spain.
The fact is, he's always intended for Spain to declare war on France!

If Mortimer's plan succeeds, the United States will indeed double in size.
it would mean the end of the Spanish presence in North America.
If Mortimer's conference is successful, French forces on the North American continent could literally change the balance of competing armies.
