The Last Judgement, by Weyden. Pure Flemish style. Still, cannot be the original. No...  That's impossible.
Lord Mortimer makes these tonics available to guests. A nice touch!
Enough said; do you require anything more of me?
Enough, my son.
I was just leaving, Your Grace.
It seems that I am not the only one you annoy, Mr. Mauras.
But then, just now, as you entered my room, I realised it was not Lord Mortimer that was linked to my darkest fears.
But it was you!
Wait Your Grace, I... 
Back! Back, demon! Back!
No, your words will not unsettle my mind! Gabriel, I call upon you; protect me from this Devil.
[to himself] That's Aramaic. A form of incantation against the devil!
Well this is just what I needed!
Let me explain, Your Grace... 
Away from me, demon! Flee before the Almighty!
What are you doing … What is that?
I do not fear you, Lucifer, Prince of Darkness! Neither you nor your spawn! Vade Vade Retro Satanas!
[To Mauras] What's happening to you, Louis?
[To Mortimer] I don't know. I think I feel unwell …
He is here! I feel the presence of the Evil One in this room!
By the strength...  by the strength of Santo Christopher! Santo Francesco and Santo Jude! Please, Give me your strength!
Stop, Piaggi! Stop, stop! Piaggi! Stop!
[To Mauras] Give yourself over to me, Louis.
[To Mauras] Already you are unable to perform what I expected of you; now I am taking control.
[To Mauras] You followed my instructions; now let me help you.
[To Mauras] You just have to accept me.
NNNNNOOooo!!!
[To Mauras] Just let me enter you, Louis.
[To Mauras] I am here my son, all is well.
[To Mauras] Don't be foolish, Louis!
[To Mauras] You're still my son and I will not let this fool attack us in this manner!
[To Mauras] I'm sorry, my son, but from now on, I am taking things into my own hands!
[To Mortimer] No more!
You surprise me, Piaggi.
I'm surprised that a member of the Catholic church such as you, would believe in such pagan incantation.
I do not fear you, Demon!
One must fight Evil with Evil!
[To Mortimer] What will you do to him?!!
[To Mauras] Do not worry about him, my son. His fate is of very little importance.
[To Mortimer] No, wait! I …
Enough, old man!
Where did you think you were going with those poems from another age?
You have no hold on me!
Shut up!
I think you shouldn't have risked going this far, Giuseppe.
Now you will return to Rome and serve me as required!
And when the time comes, your opinion will be sought on the papal succession.
You will choose your old student, yes, Barnaba Chiaramonti Niccolo, and you will push him to be the next Pope!
Was I clear?
[To Mortimer] What is clear to me, my brother, is that you are cheating!
We were not to intervene directly!
You're breaking our pact!
That old fool used Canum Mortis Seculem on Louis! What was I to do?
I protect my children! That's all.
Stop! Stop. You protect no one besides you and your inflated ego!
You were forbidden to act directly. You know that.
Now, it's I who face you!
And I order you to remain in your place!
How dare you, Gregory?!
Do not underestimate me!
How dare you attack me directly!
For centuries our father has forbidden this! You break the rules!
Always the same attack, my brother!
I know you by heart!
You go too far this time, William! You've broken the first rule! Father will punish you for this!
My turn, little brother.
You should never have broken our pact, William.
You always did as you pleased. Father will never let us fight again. It was almost the end of us, the last time.
You will be punished for this!
Shut up, Gregory!
You just love the sound of your own voice. You're always doing Father's bidding! When will you realise that we are just his puppets! Enough is enough! Our time has come!
You're crazy, my brother … Crazy
Stop, William! You've already lost.
I am sorry, Louis. You may be family, but you must accept responsibility for the mistakes of your father.
Now, you are mine.
Now it's my turn to play, little brother!
Do not be so sure, madame. 
I was thinking of how you could take your revenge upon him. 
Mauras! Did you ever find il Duce Manuel?
No, not yet, Monsignore.
Please follow me, if you will. I shall help you.
Mr. Mauras. You seem lost.
I'm looking for Duke Manuel. Have you seen him?
Follow me, my son, I shall help you.
It would seem as though Duke Manuel is not here.
I know; he was pressed for time and has already taken the boat.
I did not bring you here for that.
Excuse me??!!
I don't understand. You did say that you would help me?
That is correct. You need help, my son.
Perhaps you may not recognise it, but you very much need my help. I shall free you.
...  Cabrón! You can forget all agreements between us!
I will do anything to oppose your plans!
You've just made a powerful enemy... 
Cabrón! Now I can see you as you truly are!
I am glad I resisted your pathetic attempts to convince me!
You have made yourself a powerful enemy... 
Leave, my friend.
I wish you bon courage, your Grace.
Are you all right, Your Grace?
