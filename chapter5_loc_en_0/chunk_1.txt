No, Louis no...
The longer you remain in his presence, the more danger you're in...
Just get out of here!
Wait...
I have a proposal to make to you.
LEAVE
Ahahahah! Come back! Or you shall feel my wrath!
LISTEN TO THE PROPOSAL
I'm listening...
William has to pay for what he did. He had no right!
No one must ever attack a member of one's own family! That is the law...
If you don't want to be involved in all this, let me enter your mind...
When the time comes, I will just step in.
You mean... like with Elizabeth?
Elizabeth was not part of our family.
She didn't get any choice.
But you can't say it worked out well for her.
What's to say that once inside he won't stay there?
If I ask my children to respect the rules, then I must do so, as well.
So? Do you accept my proposal?
ACCEPT
Very well.
I accept.
Good...
Pursue your goal now...
When the time comes, I will take care of William.
REFUSE
I'm sorry, I... I'd rather not get involved in your disputes.
I understand that you're mad at him, but I refuse to let you use me, to get at him.
Young fool!
Goodbye...
No!
Come back! Or you too shall feel my wrath!
 Stop, Louis...
The more you remain in his presence the more you are in danger...
Get out of here!
Wait...
I have a proposal to make to you.
LEAVE
Come back! Or you shall feel my wrath!

No!
Come back! Or you too shall feel my wrath!
Let's see what he think...
Aaahhh yes! That is good, come, open up...
Ah! Louis Mauras de Richet, son of William Mortimer, now I see you!
Damn it, I can feel him entering inside me... I shouldn't have...
William!
You dirty traitor!
No! No! Gregory!
You have no right, William! You are violating the rules!
MY rules!
I can't break the link!
Get out of my mind!
William should have taught you not to try to read just anyone's mind...
Resist, Louis!
It's pointless!
Father! Help me!
Louis! What's happening?!
Father?!
Ah! William!
I can't feel you anymore!
William! You dirty traitor! What did you do to Gregory?!
NO! Not now, NO! Louis, get out of here! ! GET OUT!!
Get out of here, Louis!
My son Gregory sent you here to find an ally.
Well, you have found him!
Now that I'm inside you, you are going to exit the Ether and return to William!
It's time I settled my scores!
Let's see what he think...
Aaahhh yes! That's good, open up...
Louis Mauras de Richet, son of William Mortimer, now I see you!
Ah, damn it, I can feel him entering inside me... I shouldn't have...
William!
You dirty traitor!
No! Gregory!
You have no right, William! You are violating the rules!
