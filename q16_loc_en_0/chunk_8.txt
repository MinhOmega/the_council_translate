She is my masterpiece!
Emma, no! He's lying...
Shut up!
Why does it bother you so much that he could love me?
Emma, he's only trying to bring us down!
Without you, we're lost!
You're jealous!
Go on then, Louis, prove to me he's lying!
He wants to devour us!
Don't listen to him, Emma!
Ever since the beginning, the only thing he's ever wanted, is to devour us!
Look what he did to his own brother!
I would never lay a finger on her! She is my pride and joy!
You're the one who's trying to manipulate her, Louis!
You're the one who convinced her to stand here in front of me, hoping to kill me!
You are peddling the lie to anyone who will listen that my sole desire is to devour your spirits...
But where on earth did you get that idea?
From what you did to Gregory!
And then there are the paintings!
I... what? What paintings?
Saturn devouring his children!
What? Do you mean to say your entire plan rests on a feeble interpretation of my paintings?
Is this some kind of joke?!
Emma! Emily! Is this the kind of talk he's been using to persuade you to kill me?
It's... yes, he...
He stares a while at my paintings, and the only thing he comes up with is that, obviously, I must be a disgusting child-murderer!
Please! Is that the only possible conclusion?
None of you considered that perhaps, I might be nothing more than a collector enamored with a particular style?
No! Of course not! Let's all just agree I'm a cannibal instead! That makes it so much simpler!
Louis...
He has a point, Louis... You're the one who brought us here.
Why? Tell us why we shouldn't believe him...
Emma! Look at her! Trust your sister!
Emma.
Look at her... Look at Emily...
You know her. She knows you.
But... I...
Go on, look at her.
It is her! She loves you! She's counting on you...
Emma!
Help us!
My sister...
Remember what Holm told us!
Don't believe him, Emma!!
Look at what he did to Gregory! His own brother!
You have no idea who he really was!!
I knew him!! I endured his bullying!!
He was a vicious manipulator!
Look at yourselves!! Why are you here?!
Who persuaded you to kill me! Your very own father!!
Don't you think that since your arrival here, at my home, if I really wanted to kill you, I would have had every opportunity?
Louis...
No! Emma!! Don't believe him!...
But Louis... it's true!
Who persuaded us to attack him?
Who whispered a plan in our ears?
What can you say to dispute that?...
GOOD OUTCOME
Get him!
Ah!
Louis! NOW!
Arm yourself with a nail
Arm yourself with the Lance
Arm yourself with the Lance
No, Don't do it!
It's over. You've lost!
No, Louis! No! Stop!
Ah!
My son...
And to think you did all that for nothing...
What do you mean?
Louis?
Em...
Louis!
Didn't he tell you?
He was poisoned several days ago.
He was condemned.
He sacrificed himself for us...
What a pity he got the wrong lance...
Huh?... What have you done to me...
I hope you aren't in a hurry, my daughter, because you are going to die here. Don't expect any of the family to come to my place, in the Ether, to bring you back, this time...
Thanks a lot, Louis...
Come, Louis. It's over.
Let's leave...
After you...
... you will regret your actions when you see him...
Come, Louis. It's over.
Let's leave...
You go on, I'll meet you on the wharf.
BAD OUTCOME
This is all your fault!!
No, Emma, stay concentrated!!
To hell with your plan!
Emma!...
Louis manipulated us, Emily!!
Open your eyes, for crying out loud!
Stop!
Emma, no! What on earth are you doing?
Let him deal with Father himself!
It is not my problem!
