Your body is corrupted. The poison has been spreading inside you for too long.
It has already caused irreparable damage.
You are of no use to me now...
I beg your pardon?
You see, when the time comes for me to changes bodies, I usually pass into the body of one of my children.
The transition is much smoother and allows me to be operational much more quickly.
Seeing the good work you had done since your arrival, I was convinced I had found my next body.
Could only be you!
But then you had to go and ruin everything...
Scumbag!
You dirty bastard!
That's what you had planned for me all along, isn't it?
I was never anything more than the envelope for your next life?
Oh, please, do let us try and retain some dignity, shall we...
Let's not fall prey to being "pathetic".
We're better than that...
You bastard!
He's lying...
But... Father! Why are you telling me this?
Not after all I've done! I...
I beseech you!
Don't make this any harder than it already is, please...
Harder?
Listen, just be grateful that I'm granting you your freedom!
Now, I'll ask you to leave me and be gone within the hour!
Moreover, if I were you, I wouldn't waste a single second in sterile conversation because I'm not so sure that poison will even let you see the French coast again...
But thinking about it... One more thing...
Of course... Anything I can do for you, Father.
Give me Al Azif, if you please...
It won't be of any use to you.
Here you are.
Take your wretched grimoire!
And go choke yourself on it!!
You can go...
Whatever next?
Is that a joke?
Don't try my patience, Louis!
Never!
Or else what? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna kill me?
Big deal... I'd rather die than know it was in your hands!
How typical of you...
I won't let you d...
What on earth are you thinking?
That you'll be able to kill me?
This is ridiculous, Louis...
Come now, be reasonable.
You damned...
I should have never listened to you!!...
Rot in hell!
But the important thing is that you escaped the worst with WÃ¶llner, because he could have killed you when you were in the guise of Piaggi!
Yes, it was a bit touch and go...
Which leads me to a chat about what I envisage for you now...
You are the chosen one, Louis!
The one I've been waiting for all this time!
Thank you, I...
We are going to be able to become one!
Mmmm... I... I don't quite follow you...
Be proud of yourself, son!
For you are the one I have chosen to be my next mortal coil!
I... I but... what about me?
Am I imagining things or did he just tell me to my face that he's going to eat me?
Unfortunately, no, you won't survive the transfer but I want you to know that I only select my bodies from my own children, and that you are the one who has impressed me most!
It's far from being my first time, as you can imagine.
I didn't think it was possible to find a more promising son than dear Augustus! You can be very proud of yourself!
Wait a second, hang on... do you realize what you're saying?
Are you insane?
Aw! Come, come, my son!
Let's not end everything on a bad note, please.
Son of a bitch!
He's not going to get away with this so easily!
You're not gonna get away with this!
That's quite enough! Who do you think you are?!
Be reasonable and let yourself go... it will save you a lot of pointless suffering, believe me.
I must make him get closer to me!
Come now, don't complicate things...
Wait...
I have something else you want...
Well, look at that... You found it...
Decidedly, you are very resourceful, Louis.
You impress me... right up to the very last!
For Al Azif, I am willing to get closer...
Hit the scumbag with the nail!
Wait... no... I...
The blood of an ancient...
Hahaha! I... I was... right...my son...
You really are... the very best...
Hit the scumbag with the lance!
No!
No! Not now...
You... You've... ruined everything...
Like father, like son!
Congratulations, my son! You had a backup plan...
Well I did learn from the best!
What a pity you got the wrong lance...
I... Oh holy shit! No, NO!!
Leave me.
I've done it!
It worked!!
If only you hadn't gotten the wrong lance...
I do wish it didn't have to turn out this way, you know.
