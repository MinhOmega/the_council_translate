Tell me, Emma...
Are you sure you were right to bring your sister back in that grotesque body?
Don't listen to him, Emma!
Careful, Emma! He's trying to manipulate you!
Please tell me he's lying, right?
You won't try anything against me afterward, right?
Of course not!
How can you doubt me?
She spent her life creating this identity, day after day, playing the main role and now you think she's going to accept becoming your servant?
How can I believe you?
It was always you who chose what we wore! You always chose where we lived!
I was naive to think you would ever let me have a life.
Damn it... Emma is starting to have doubts...
No, Emma!
Look at us! This is exactly what he wants!
Don't let him into your mind!
If we stick together, we can beat him!
We are united, Emma!
Don't listen to him, Emma!
Emily gave you her word that she would leave you the Duchess!
Have faith in her!
Your efforts are futile, Father! I have faith in my sister!
And me, in her!
Perfect! They won't let themselves be taken in...
On the contrary, Emma, it's the chance of her life!
On the contrary, Emma!
Emily will be able to exist by herself!
Once she's changed bodies, you'll finally be able to live your own separate lives!
No more resentment or comparisons ever again!
We will be free at last, Emma!
Perfect!
Divert Mortimer's attention!
Mortimer! Is this how you managed to manipulate your brother?
Now, now, Louis, don't think you can change the topic so easily!
The question remains open.
Emma. After everything Emily has been through, a life lost creating this character, do you really think she's going to just let you take over the main role?
Emily! I promised you we would find you a better body!
I'll do everything in my power to help you...
No, no, stop, Emma! He's trying to manipulate you!
You killed her, and now you think she's just going to, what, leave it at that?
I know... you will never forgive me...
Don't listen to him, Emma, I swear I mean you no harm!
Oh shit! He's succeeding!
Emily, you have always been the dominant one!
And you expect me to believe that you're now going to simply hand over your whole life's work?
You can't fool me, my girl! I can read you like a book!
It's a lie, Emma!
Emma, he's lying!
Don't listen to him! He'd do anything to undermine us!
No, it's true, Louis...
The Emily I knew would never have accepted such humiliation...
Emma, no!
Trust me!
She spent her life creating this identity, day after day, and playing the main role, and you think now she's going to agree to be your servant?
I am sure you have already planned your vengeance...
Damn it, she's yielding!
No, Emma!
Stay calm, I beg you! You're playing right into his hands!
It's not true! Emma is stronger than Emily!
You're wrong, Father!
You don't know your daughters very well! After what Emma has gone through, I can assure you, she's much more resillant than her sister!
Yes... it's true...
She would never have born up to a quarter of what I had to go through...
Wait, so that's what you think of me?...
I... No, Emily, it's... it's not what I...
So this is our â€˜partnership'!
I'm but a pale reflection of my sister, is that it?
No! Excuse me, Emily!
That's not what I meant!
Believe me!
Emma, think of the good times!
Emma! Remember!
Remember everything you've shared together!
Remember all the times you counted on each other!
You were united like no one else can be!
Stay concentrated, Emma!
Count on me, sister!
Great! They're supporting each other!
As long as Emma doesn't falter..
They are both equal
Emma, Emily, don't believe a single word of what he's saying.
You both braved hell together! United!
And that's the only way we can get out of here!
Louis is right, Emma!
Yes! You are right, Louis!
We will not be mislead by this kind of manipulation, Father!
Good, we stand firm!
If this continues, Mortimer won't have any hold on us!
Emma, my dear daughter, let me help you!
You have won! Look, you have it all!
You are Duchess Hillsborrow! You are rich! You are young, beautiful, influential!
I'm so proud of you!
You are the one I've been waiting for...
You know what she's like. You know she harbors vengeance in her heart. She will never let you have all this to yourself. Never.
I beseech you, let me help you... let me protect you, darling...
Don't listen to him! He doesn't love you!
Emma! He's a snake!
Don't believe him! He doesn't love us!
Ohoho! Speak for yourself, my son!
Just because you are a great shame to me doesn't mean she is too.
