I found a service key last time...  let's see... 
Search the chest of drawers
The key's gone...  Emily must still have it with her.
Move away
I found a service key last time...  let's see... 
Search the chest of drawers
The key's gone...  Emily must still have it with her.
Move away
Louis! At last, there you are!
Mother, wait, I...
Come, we have to be quick...
No, wait, Mother, I...
Time is running out, Louis, first we must...
... No!
That's enough!
I won't go a step further unless you explain to me what is going on here!...
I'm begging you...  talk to me...
You must trust me, my son.
You are not ready yet...
You are the one who should trust me.
Tell me what's happening.
You would never believe me.
I came all the way here for you. Now I've found you.
I'm ready, Mother
If only...
Louis, I have always taught you to keep your mind open and rational.
I know you are going to find it hard to believe but what I am going to reveal to you is entirely true.
Many years ago, I found out that Demons really do live among us...
I beg your pardon.
...and that they can influence our thoughts.
Mother, listen to yourself...
I know you're exhausted but, for crying out loud, listen to what you're saying!
Demons? What next?
A ancient monster with a head like an octopus?
What do your Demons look like? Have they got horns and a pointed tail?
No, these are not creatures with billy-goat's legs! Forget your Christian folklore!
Imagine them more as parasitic spirits...
They possess their hosts and direct them from inside...
Parasitic spirits?
Yes...  they are capable of going from one body to another, as they see fit.
And two of them are present on this island.
Right...  So let me guess:
Mortimer and Holm?
Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory, right?
You felt it too?
No, even if Holm does look the part...
But I don't know who else could do it, given that we're on their territory?
Washington and Bonaparte?
President Washington and Monsieur Bonaparte.
No, why?
At least, I don't think so.
Yet Washington is old enough to be one.
Wöllner and Godoy?
Don't tell me, it isn't Wöllner and Duke Manuel, is it?
Don't talk nonsense!
Both of those poor souls are mere pawns in the hands of the real players.
I was answering at random, Mother.
The boogeyman and Father Christmas?
I'd put my money on The Bogeyman and Father Christmas!
Do you really believe that I'm joking here?
Many years ago, well before you were born, I crossed paths with one of them.
Since then I've spent my life trying to find it again...
When we recovered the Al Azif, I was persuaded that von Borchert was working for this Demon in one way or another.
But I thought he would hand the Book to a middleman during this conference.
That's where I made an error, an error that could well turn out to be fatal.
The one who Borchert was meant to give the Book to was none other than the Demon in person, Mortimer.
Not to mention that Holm had sent Wöllner to get it for him.
Holm and Mortimer are Demons?
They both seemed to disagree about many things, but I'll admit I never knew exactly why.
There are many of them, Louis. Not just those two.
Mother, have you any proof to support any of this?
Of course.
But you do, too...
You had everything laid out in front of you. Didn't you notice anything?
Yes, in fact
Property deeds
Well, those property deeds across the world, all signed by the same hand, and over several centuries...
I am proud of you, Louis.
I found your notes written in lemon juice.
"Where all eyes size you up... "
At one stage, I was so afraid of losing my mind that I noted everything down.
Congratulations, Louis!
Wait, please tell me you didn't open Pandora's box!
The urn?
Yes, I did, why?...
Too bad, we'll deal with it later...
No, I didn't, why?...
Good! We'll deal with it later...
His family tree
I came across his family tree, in his study.
An only son...
Since the Third Crusade.
The fall of Saint John of Acre, Louis!
The fall of Saint John of Acre!
His secret study
I went beyond the nightmare, Mother.
You understood the masonic date.
1 - 1 - 9 - 1
Of course! It was during that siege that the Demon took possession of Sir Mortimer.
They spent a whole night in conversation until the early hours of the morning. Mortimer had passed the test...
He had charmed the Demon and so it chose him to be its host for centuries to come.
But tell me, did you find his secret study?
I did, indeed!
Did you see his maps of the world?
He has contacts the world over.
Yes...  I've been developing the Golden Order across the world for many years.
And I've never seen anyone with such influence...
It's simply inhuman!
The fact that no one knows him
I must admit I found it difficult to understand how and why Mortimer didn't have a place in History,
On the continent, Mortimer and Holm are mere dandies who organize society balls.
History forgets them with a disconcerting facility. No one speaks about them and yet they whisper in the ears of Kings and Presidents.
The conference?
You mean the conference?
How can you explain that someone manages to bring together so many important figures without anyone knowing?
And without any security or personnel...
That's all, I think
Louis, I am proud of you!
You came all this way, you've found me...  you have surpassed me!
You taught me everything I know.
Right, how did it all begin?
I think that that's all I've found out.
You are not even close...
Don't listen to her mad talk!
Mother, I shan't follow you down that path.
I wouldn't be doing you any favors.
Rational and open, Louis...
Tell me, then, how can anyone own properties all over the world for centuries always having signed documents with the same signature?
Well, I can find ten other explanations less eccentric than demonic possession, Mother...
How come the Mortimers have had only one male heir for each generation since the Third Crusade?
Forgery, family rites where they get rid of the daughter, there are dozens of less extravagant possibilities!
How could one man motivate so many future leading figures of the day on his silly island without anyone finding out about it?
Even the Golden Order isn't capable of that!
Well, he's simply better than us, and he's welcome to it!
You refuse to open your eyes, Louis!
You've lost your objectivity, Mother!
I saw him!
Wh...  What do you mean, you saw him?
I was twenty years old. I was young and carefree. I traveled the world in search of adventure.
In the Persian Golf, we came across an ancient grimoire that became unlocked.
Composed of seven parts, each one was a book in itself, set in a sort of metal armor that structured the whole thing.
When all the volumes were brought together, they formed a single book...
On my return to Paris, I set to studying these pages. I spent all my days and nights studying them.
Oh, I can imagine you doing that...
But the writing was in a language I had never seen before, developed well before Sumerian, in my opinion.
So I got the idea to form a small occult circle, composed of all the major names in the Occult world, to see if anyone else could crack it.
And you found no one...
And I found someone, Louis.
I found him. Or rather, he found me.
He was young, charismatic, he was flamboyant!
Mortimer?
You mean Mortimer?
Holm?
Sir Gregory?
No, Mortimer, of course.
Von Borchert?
Wait a minute, who are you talking about? Von Borchert?
No, no, Mortimer, of course.
He was a veritable mine of knowledge.
I showed him the Book and he was able to decipher a few passages.
We spent several months together studying the pages.
Let her continue
But how old was he?
He was already old in those days, wasn't he?
So you recognized him when you arrived on the island, right?
No, he wasn't in that body.
But I know it was him!
I swear it was him. The way he spoke, his posture, a few of his intonations, his mannerisms.
Wait a minute, you were talking about sixty years ago. I've lost the thread...
Yes, sorry.
He helped me understand certain passages until I realized that he only translated a few parts for me.
But I had aroused his interest. It was too late.
How so?
I mean to say he manipulated me, he used me and in the end he stole the Book with all its secrets.
Did he ever go to your place?
Not once...  at least I don't think so.
But before disappearing he proposed a pact between us.
He proposed that I follow him and let him teach me, allow him to bring me up.
Shit, she caved!
And you accepted...
Please, don't be stupid,
No! She must have refused!
And you refused of course!
Why, naturally, Louis.
You don't make deals with the devil.
After that, I spent my whole life looking for him.
Three years later, in Berlin, I just missed him.
In London, I lost six members of the Order in a chase.
In 1741, in Tunisia, I found a sect of fanatics who had crossed paths with him once.
1741, in Poland, 1749, in India!
Eight years ago, in Venice?
We agreed never to speak about what happened in Venice, Louis.
Don't insist
Insist
YOU agreed! And that was before you spoke to me about demons!
Wait, the baby we delivered, you and me, that night, in Venice, did he have anything to do with Lord Mortimer?
The child was his son.
We stole his son? Are you insane!!!
I always thought we took him to save him!
That was the case! It was precisely to save him from his father!
Need I remind you the mother died during childbirth?
What became of the child?
Later!
For the moment, that is not the key issue here.
Once we found the Al Azif in Paris, I followed von Borchert's trail here...
I didn't think it would lead me straight to the Demon, it was careless of me.
He toyed with me for a few days...  Until I caught on. Until I saw him as he was.
But he had no intention of letting me leave.
We are all his pawns, Louis, and if we don't want to spend the rest of our lives turning round in circles here, we must absolutely get off this island.
Alright, can we move on?
Wait a minute, one last thing.
What happened with Elizabeth?
I want to know want happened with Elizabeth Adams.
Louis, we haven't time for those details!
Very well
You're probably right...
I must know
I'm sorry, Mother, but I want to know.
She was one of the receptacles for these monsters.
I met her parents when she was born. One of the demons got inside her.
The Demon used her to spy on her father, John Adams. He is one of the Founding Fathers and vice president of the United States, you know.
Mortimer possessed her?
No, I don't think it was Mortimer...
Her father, John Adams, hired me to tend to her but the evil in her was too deep.
In spite of the various treatments I tried on her, I never succeeded in getting it out of her.
It's not something I'm proud of, Louis, but I had to try everything.
Who killed her?
Do you know who killed her?
Absolutely not.
Did you kill her?
Mother, did you kill her?
Of course not! Don't be stupid!
I had no interest in getting rid of her.
What happened with Emma?
I want to know what happened between you and Emily's sister!
Great responsibility often brings difficult choices, Louis.
That's all you need to know.
Alright then, we'll see later
Alright, but you're not getting away with it so lightly...
Once we get back to Paris, be sure I won't be letting it go!
We'll see in Paris then.
Tell me everything!
Mother, I won't take a step further if you don't answer me.
You dare blackmail me?
I'm listening.
Alright! I used her! So there you are! Happy now?
We had the Al Azif and I didn't think we would be able to escape with it.
In order to ensure that the Book did not fall into their hands, or that one of them couldn't read in us where we had hidden it, I asked Emily to...
It's Emma!
Yes, or rather for me it was Emily...
So I asked Emma to hide it without anyone seeing, and then I disposed of her.
I am sorry for her but she was part of the Golden Order, Louis. She knew the rules when she joined.
Did you negotiate the Al Azif with Wöllner?
What did you negotiate about the AL Azif with Wöllner?
Absolutely nothing. I managed to pull the wool over his eyes until I found a way to flee.
Why the cannons for Bonaparte?
What was going on with the cannons in Tuscany?
It was nothing.
Drop it
We are talking about a war!
Since when does the Order finance wars?
The cannons for that Bonaparte fellow?
Listen, once in the lion's den, I did whatever I could to appear legitimate...
So, yes, I pretended to be interested in Mortimer's project about a young military man who was seeking funding for a foundry in Tuscany...
Between you and me, if buying China would have enabled me to escape, I would have signed without hesitation.
Others
I found your letter on the wharf
Samuel Riter Dauchois.
You wanted to send me a letter about Godoy.
I wanted you to run a check on Duke Manuel.
But frankly, it doesn't really matter anymore now.
Godoy is just a pawn like the others. He is not the one I was looking for.
Why did you hide your effects on the wharf?
You know, I found your package under a wharf plank.
As a matter of fact I needed it yesterday. I wasn't expecting anyone to take it.
Thanks for not touching it.
Piaggi's letter
On the evening of my arrival, Cardinal Piaggi came looking for you. He was determined to give you a letter.
More of his lists!
Louis, I think I know what's in that letter and I beseech you to believe that it is the least of our worries.
We can sort that out later.
Your hand
Are you gonna tell me what happened to your hand?
Better than that! I shall show you.
Go back
Go on, it's alright
Good, I think that's about right.
We shall speak about it once we get back to France.
Great actions for humanity have been decided by Demons for centuries, Louis.
They are playing with our destiny. We are their slaves.
And it's time for it to stop!
By the way, what was Mortimer's project at this conference?
He wants the United States to occupy all the north American territory.
France should recover Louisiana and give it to the United States.
In that case, the Americans would just have to push west to chase the Spanish from the continent once and for all.
And as Mortimer controls Washington, you may just as well say that it will put him at the head of a world superpower.
He demands that the Spanish hand over Louisiana to France.
Oh, knowing him, it won't stop there.
But I don't really know. I couldn't attend because of my injuries.
Too bad.
We should do our utmost to put a stop to Mortimer's plans.
But for the time being, there are more pressing matters.
Are you going to tell me why we are here?
There, that's why we are here!
I found out that Napoleon Bonaparte is firmly committed to supporting Lord Mortimer 
I could have been a witness of Napoleon Bonaparte's resolution
I found out that Cardinal Piaggi has not been perturbed by the events
I could have spoken with Piaggi about his motivations 
I found out that von Wöllner had fount Al Azif
I could have learned something from Al Azif
I left traces behind in Napoleon Bonaparte's room
I managed to go through Napoleon Bonaparte's room without leaving a trace
I persuaded von Wöllner to leave Jacques Péru's room
I tried to understand what had happened to Jacques Péru when I saw him in his room
I didn't try to understand what had happened to Jacques Péru when saw him in his room
I could have gone through Jacques Péru's room to get to the balcony
I went to see the crowd outside Lady Hillsborrow's room
I protected one of the Hillsborrow twins
I could have gone to see the crowd outside Lady Hillsborrow's room
I could have gone through Napoleon Bonaparte's room to get to the balcony
Monsieur de Richet...
I have no time, I was about to join Sir Gregory.
Come back later.
Just one moment...  it's about Péru.
I wanted to talk to you a moment and...
I'm expected.
I'm sorry.
We shall talk later.
See you later.
Alright, I'll be off then.
Thank you.
What on earth is...
You...
Mother?
How dare you do this to me?
You can talk!
After everything I've done for you!
You are joking, I hope, right?
I gave you my life!
That's enough, Emma!
Now that Louis is here, you will leave Sarah alone!
Cease your revenge immediately!
Wh... What?
If you think you're going to...
Louis!! Help me, I beg you, I can no longer reason with her.
I am Emily! Quit playing games!
I... What?
Honestly, don't be ridiculous!
No, I am Emily! You are wasting your time, Louis knows very well how to tell us apart.
After everything we've been through together!
Yes... well...
Don't you dare bring him into this, this is between you and me!
I ask for nothing more! So stop taking it out on Sarah!
I...
You prissy little bitch! How dare you!
Now that I've told you everything, you want to take my place, do you?
You are joking, I hope! I'm the one who told you everything that's been going on while you were away!
Go on then! That's what you want, isn't it?
You want to kill me! Go on then, shoot!
After all the trouble I've gone through to find you? Go on! What are you waiting for?
Here, Louis, take this!
Wait, what's going...
An entire life for this! Go on! Shoot!
Sorry, Louis. I can't shoot her, she's my sister...
I...
That's enough, Emma!
Louis, out of the way! She's dangerous, don't trust her!
What are you trying to do?
Louis, out of the way!
I AM NOT EMMA!
Come on, Louis, tell her who the real Emily is...
Wait, I...
That's right, Louis!
I'm fed up with this little game! Tell him who the real Emily is!
Why do these things always happen to me?...
Well?
Louis, come on, you know how to tell us apart, right?!
Yes, yes but I'd like to ask you a few questions, to make sure there is no doubt.
Rational and open, Louis...
Let's see, how can I tell them apart?
Wait, I've got an idea...
On the night of our arrival...
Ask the twin in front
Who was with us?
Who was with us on the wharf?
Cardinal Piaggi.
He was with us from when we started traveling by ship. We arrived on the same boat.
I already told her, Louis...
Another question then?
I'm the one who told you!
What is my job?
You had asked me what had become of me since we last met in London some years before.
What did I answer?
You are an Occultist, Louis.
You told me what happened to you at Hexham Abbey.
That you are a detective, Louis.
You even told me about your adventures regarding some news item...
What were they called now?...
Ah yes! The Chauffeurs d'Orgères!
That you are a Diplomat, Louis.
You even told me about the troubles you had saving some compatriots during the French Revolution.
I already told her, Louis...
I was there!
What happened to me?
On the wharf, something happened to me. What was it?
A malaise. The moment you arrived you felt ill.
And I offered to help while Piaggi went up.
And you turned me down flat.
What did you give me?
You gave me something.
I wasn't feeling very well and you gave me something!
What was it?
My handkerchief...
And you even kept it! It was stained with your blood.
Louis, I already told her. This is all a waste of time...
I'm the one who told YOU!
Ask the twin behind
Who was with us?
Who was with us on the wharf?
Cardinal Piaggi, who couldn't stop talking.
Louis, I already told her about our arrival...
I know because I was there!
The cardinal went up, you felt poorly, Louis, and I offered you my handkerchief!
I was there!
What is my job?
You asked me what had become of me since we last met in London, many years ago.
What did I answer?
You told me that you had become an occultist, Louis.
You know that because I told you!
You even told me about your setbacks at Hexham Abbey, remember?
You told me you had become a Detective, Louis.
You only know that because I told you!
You even told me about your exploits with the thieves who tortured their victims.
What were they called again?...
The Chauffeurs d'Orgères, I think...
You told me you had become a Diplomat, Louis.
You know that because I told you!
Remember, you told me about the difficulty you had saving some British compatriots during the revolution.
I was the one who told you that!
Liar! I was there!
What happened to me?
On the wharf, something happened to me. What happened exactly?
You felt unwell, you had a nose bleed.
And I offered you my handkerchief...
I told her all that already...
It was me who told you!
What did you give me?
You handed me something.
I wasn't feeling very well and you handed me something!
What was it?
My handkerchief...
...and you stained it with your blood.
You still have it, as a matter of fact.
But she already knows all this, Louis. It's a waste of time.
Right, let's find something else...
Ah yes, let's speak about my arrival at the manor!
Question the twin in front
Who was already there at the chimney?
When we arrived at the Manor, someone was already present in the Great Hall.
Who was it?
President Washington!
She knows about this part as well, I'm warning you...
Obviously, I told you!
Who stayed with who?
Once at the Manor, Sir Gregory introduced himself to us then we split up into two groups.
What group was I in?
It won't work, Louis. She knows already, I told her.
Shut up! I'm the one who told you!
You stayed with President Washington and myself, near the chimney...
Because he was freezing and wanted to speak to you about your mother.
You left with Sir Gregory and Cardinal Piaggi.
And you ran into Miss Adams.
I told you she knew.
How did Mortimer welcome us?
On the night of our arrival, we were warming ourselves in front of the fire. Mortimer welcomed us in a very odd way.
What happened?
It won't work, Louis.
It wasn't Mortimer who welcomed us...
It was Sir Gregory.
Sorry, Louis, I already told her.
What did we speak about?
Once we arrived, we stayed together warming ourselves in front of the fire in the Great Hall, with President Washington.
That's right.
What did we talk about?
The President and I revealed to you that we were members of the Order.
You even asked Washington how he met your mother, remember?
Pose a question to Emily behind me.
Who was already by the chimney?
When we arrived at the Manor, someone was already present in the Great Hall. Who was it?
George Washington, President of the United States, Louis.
Of course you are able to reply, I'm the one who told you!
Who stayed with who?
Once at the Manor, we split up into two groups.
What group did I choose?
You stayed with me.
Along with President Washington.
And we informed him that we were members of the Order.
You decided to follow Sir Gregory and Cardinal Piaggi into the small salon.
And he ran into Miss Adams.
Of course you know all this! I'm the one who told you about it!
How did Mortimer welcome us?
On the night of our arrival, we were warming ourselves in front of the fire. Mortimer welcomed us in a certain way.
What happened exactly?
Well played, Louis, unfortunately, I'm not the one you should have asked that question to.
Mortimer did not welcome us.
It was Sir Gregory who welcomed us that night.
Mortimer didn't show up until two days later! I know that as well!
What did we speak about?
Once we'd arrived, we stayed together warming ourselves in front of the fire in the Great Hall, with President Washington.
What did we talk about?
We spoke about your mother.
The President revealed our membership of the Order to you, and that we had everything to gain by trusting one another, Louis.
You remember?
Very well...
Let's try something else...
On the first night... we went up to bed. But I wasn't tired, I went for a little stroll...
Speak to the twin in front
Did we see each other?
Do you remember if we saw each other that night or not?
Not at all.
Of course, how could I forget?
In my room, in fact!
In MY room!
You wanted to spy on Bonaparte's room from the balcony and thought it a great idea to go through mine.
I am sorry for putting that knife to your throat, by the way. I hope I didn't leave any marks.
Did we speak to each other?
Did we get a chance to speak?
Certainly not. I was exhausted and went to bed.
Indeed, we did! Even with a knife at your throat!
And for good reason! You had no business being in my room!
In MY room!
What did you ask me?
The reason why you were in my room, of course.
I asked you if it had anything to do with the Order!
Stop there!
And I advised you to ask for permission next time you wanted to go through my room to spy on Bonaparte.
And I threw you out without ceremony!
Was there anything you reproached me for?
We ran into each other a little later.
The situation in which we talked made you reproach me for something.
What was it?
I did not appreciate you entering my room uninvited.
I would have rather you had come for a different reason than to spy on the room next door...
What did I take from you?
During the night, I had the opportunity of entering your room.
For some reason, I...I couldn't help taking something from you...
An origami...
An origami bird!
Speak to the twin behind.
Did we see each other?
Do you remember if we saw each other that night or not?
No, not after going up to bed.
Of course, Louis. You broke into my room.
That doesn't prove a thing, I was the one who told you that!
Did we speak?
Before going to bed, I went for a stroll.
Did we speak to each other during that stroll?
You must be mistaken. After going up to bed, I went straight to sleep.
A stroll?
Through my room in the middle of the night. You call that a stroll, Louis?
No, I grant you that, I just wanted to make sure.
What did we say to each other at that precise moment in time?
I asked you what you were doing there, what you were playing at on the balcony and if it was anything to do with the Golden Order.
And then?
Then I suggested you first ask permission the next time you wanted to go through my room.
I threw you out!
But she knows all that, Louis, I already told her.
Ask her if I watched her sleep.
Before going to bed, I went through your room.
Do you remember?
How can I forget?
Of course, I told you!
For reasons that only concern yourself, you found it appropriate to stop and watch me sleeping in a state of undress.
I hope the show was worth it.
And I rid you of the desire to renew the experience when, on your way back, I met you with a blade to your throat.
"Never without first being invited."
I already told her, Louis...
What did I take from you?
Finally, I went back through your room before turning in for the night and borrowed something from you.
What did I take from you?
Borrowed?
You are joking! You wanted to steal my origami piece.
MY origami piece!
But I rid you of the desire to do it again.
About the Mars case! You know very well that I still have that message from the killer, which goes to show how much the case obsessed me!
Don't think you're going to get away with this deception so easily!
I can assure you you're going to regret pretending to be me once Louis has exposed you!
Right, I don't think I'll get very far like this....
I have to find something better...
Oh I don't think I'll even wait until he's finished!
Take it easy now!
Are you mad, Louis?
Lower your arm!
I'd better act quickly if I don't want things to get out of hand...
Come on, she's putting one over on you!
Look at yourself, for crying out loud! You are prepared to shoot me down!
In the secret room, behind the study!
Talk to them about what you've been doing, maybe they haven't spoken about it between each other yet...
On the night of the disappearance of Elizabeth Adams!...
What about it?...
What do you want to know about that night?
Ask the one in front.
How did she get past the gorgon?
How did you vanquish the medusa?
The gorgon always attacks the best protected.
The sword kills the monster, the monster charges the shield, the shield reflects the light and the lantern perturbs the monster.
I didn't need more than two minutes to solve that enigma.
That's right! Make fun of us!
Where were we both?
Before going to bed, we found ourselves in an odd situation...
You surprised me searching through Mortimer's secret gallery!
Behind the chimney. You were looking for clues about your mother.
Make her talk about the objects you found
We found ourselves in Mortimer's secret gallery.
What did we find in that room?
A load of old junk that Mortimer had collected.
A so-called Pandora's box in the form of an urn, an old sheep skin that he must take for the golden fleece...
The Bible of Judas, property deeds as old as the hills, and a broken old sword...
You are wasting your time, Louis, she already knows all that...
Of course I do, I was there!
What did she think she found behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it?
A cameo...
Why?
You know very well why!
I want you to tell me...
Why did the cameo move you?
Because I thought it was my sister's!
I was worried sick that something had happened to her and I was running through the manor looking for the bitch when...
Stop lying, Emma!
You know full well the real reason I was there was because of the Al Azif.
Liar! I was there!
I haven't even got a cameo!
What did she think you had found behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it?
A cameo...
Why?
You know very well why!
I want you to tell me...
Why did the cameo move you?
Because I thought it was my sister's!
I was worried sick that something had happened to her and I was running through the manor looking for the bitch when...
Stop lying, Emma!
You know full well the reason why I was there was because of the Al Azif.
Liar!
I haven't even got a cameo!
Ask the the twin behind
How did you get past the gorgon?
Remember...
How did you manage to vanquish the medusa?
Sword toward the gorgon.
Gorgon toward the shield
Shield toward the sword.
Lantern toward the Shield.
Of course, I told her how to do it!
Where were we both?
In the Portrait Gallery, we found ourselves in a singular situation.
What happened to us?
We both went around the Manor all night like sleepwalkers, searching.
And that's how we found ourselves in Mortimer's Private Gallery, behind the chimney.
That doesn't prove a thing, I told you all that!
Make her talk about the objects you found
We found ourselves in Mortimer's secret gallery.
What relics did we find?
Property deeds in Mortimer's name dating from very long ago.
Is that all?
You mean all those mythological charms?
So there was the so-called Pandora's box that wasn't a box, actually.
The famous Golden Fleece that reeked of dead goat.
A broken sword that could have belonged to anyone.
Is that enough?
Yes, that's enough...
You looked captivated.
Of course, he bought it!
What did she think she would find behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it that moved you?
Nothing.
Wrong!
But I do remember picking up the first thing to hand and pretending to be the grieving sister to make you feel sorry for me.
What?...
You bitch! Liar!
What was it again?
A jewel, I think...
You dirty little...
A cameo... it was a cameo.
I made you think it reminded me of my sister's.
In truth I was looking for the Al Azif but I didn't dare tell you.
Shut your trap!
What did she think she would find behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
Now in that gallery, something moved you.
What was it that moved you?
Nothing.
Wrong!
But I do remember picking up the first thing to hand and pretending to be the grieving sister to make you feel sorry for me.
What?...
You bitch! Liar!
What was it again?
A jewel, I think...
You dirty little...
A cameo... it was a cameo.
I made you think it reminded me of my sister's.
In truth I was looking for the Al Azif but I didn't dare tell you.
Shut your trap!
That's enough! I've had enough of this charade!
Louis, there's only one way to tell us apart. There's just one thing I didn't tell her about in detail.
Too bad for you, Emma! I didn't want it to come to this but you leave me no choice!
Ask her about you and I.
You just lost, Emma...
I indeed didn't tell you everything about it.
Come, Louis. Speak about our intimacy.
Very well, let's talk about us!
Ask the twin in front
What did we talk about last night?
When you came to my room last night, what did we talk about?
I beg your pardon?
But...
I didn't go into your room last night.
There you are, the mask is off...
What do you mean?
Sorry, Emma, I didn't tell you everything.
She's right.
You little bitch!
She is manipulating you, Louis...
What was the reason for your visit last night?
Last night, you came to visit me and I can't help wondering why.
Why did you come to my room?
Louis, you must be mistaken. I did not go to your room last night.
And that's where your little game ends, Emma.
Because I never told you about it.
So, there, you can't answer.
Wha...
No, you didn't do that?!
I didn't want you to be jealous of Louis!
Remember how you always used to react whenever you felt you were competing against a man.
You dirty...
That's enough! I've had enough of this charade!
Why spend the night together last night?
Last night, we spent the night together. But beforehand, you insisted on talking about my choices during the conference.
Why?
I beg your pardon?
Louis, I did not go to see you last night...
Wh... Huh?
Now your true identity is exposed.
What did you do?
I didn't tell you everything, little sister.
I never told you about this episode so you know nothing of what happened last night between Louis and me.
You dirty slut...
What did you do?
Ask the twin behind
What did we talk about last night?
Last night, you came to me in my room. What exactly did we talk about?
We spoke briefly about your choices during the conference, Louis.
Wh... What do you mean?
Yes, Emma, it just so happens I didn't tell you everything.
You slu...
I never told you about this part.
I HATE YOU!
Nothing, since you spurned me.
Wh... What do you mean?
Yes, Emma, as it happens, I didn't tell you everything.
You little...
See, Louis, she didn't know that we'd seen each other last night! I never told her about it.
You slut!
Last night, what were you expecting of me?
Last night, when... when you came to my room, what exactly did you expect from me ?
That, sir, is something you would have found out if you had let me stay.
But as you didn't even have a little place in your big cold bed for me, the question will remain unanswered, regretfully.
What?
You do remember that you were quite a cad.
Look, I apologise, but now at least I know who you are.
Exactly what happened.
I was hoping you would share your bed with me.
What?...
Which I did.
And it was delicious, sir.
What do you mean, it was delicious?
You little slut! What did you do?
Believe it or not, Louis, out of fear of her jealousy, I didn't tell Emma that we spent last night together.
I HATE YOU!
What did you do last night?
Describe last night, please.
Louis, it's embarrassing. You know full well what I did last night.
I want to hear you say it.
We spent it together, of course.
What?
I came to your room after the conference and excuse me if I don't go into the details but I was mightily impressed.
What did you do?
Look how you are reacting, Emma! It's not surprising I didn't tell you about my night with Louis.
You slut!
Oh, it was hardly my finest hour, now you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry but I need to know.
I came to see you to spend the rest of the night with you but you were tired and preferred to decline my invitation.
What did you do?
I know, I never spoke to you about it.
But judging by your reaction, it was just as well. And Louis did not succumb to my charms anyway.
You slut!
That's enough, both of you!
Now I know who the real Emily is!
EMILY IS OPPOSITE YOU
It's you, Emily...
No, Louis! She is manipulating you!
No, Emma. It's her, I know it.
Despite all the trouble you've gone to to put one over on me, I know it is her.
That's enough now, Emma!
You little slut!
Don't think you are going to get away with this so easily!
You are going to stop your little game right now!
Never! I am Duchess Hillsb...
No!
Emily?
I am the duchess...
But...
You don't...
I...
Dear God, what have I done?
See what you've done?
See?...
Louis?
What on earth is...
Mother!
Go away!
You must go! Everyone is going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Come on, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I am coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
EMILY IS BEHIND YOU
You are Emily Hillsborrow.
I knew you wouldn't get it wrong, Louis.
No! You little bitch!
Watch out, Louis!
No!!
Hell, what have I done?
See what you've done?
See?
Louis?
What on earth is going...
Mother!
Go!
You must leave! Everyone's going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Go! Go, Mother!
No one must find you here!
Go!
Come, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I'm coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
What? What are you doing there?
Stop!
Goddammit! Now what's going on?
What on earth is...
You...
Mother?
How dare you do this to me?
You can talk!
After everything I've done for you!
You are joking, I hope, right?
I gave you my life!
That's enough, Emma!
Now that Louis is here, you will leave Sarah alone!
Cease your revenge immediately!
Wh... What?
If you think you're going to...
Louis!! Help me, I beg you, I can no longer reason with her.
I am Emily! Quit playing games!
I... What?
Honestly, don't be ridiculous!
No, I am Emily! You are wasting your time, Louis knows very well how to tell us apart.
After everything we've been through together!
Yes... well...
Don't you dare bring him into this, this is between you and me!
I ask for nothing more! So stop taking it out on Sarah!
I...
You prissy little bitch! How dare you!
Now that I've told you everything, you want to take my place, do you?
You are joking, I hope! I'm the one who told you everything that's been going on while you were away!
Go on then! That's what you want, isn't it?
You want to kill me! Go on then, shoot!
After all the trouble I've gone through to find you? Go on! What are you waiting for?
Here, Louis, take this!
Wait, what's going...
An entire life for this! Go on! Shoot!
Sorry, Louis. I can't shoot her, she's my sister...
I...
That's enough, Emma!
Louis, out of the way! She's dangerous, don't trust her!
What are you trying to do?
Louis, out of the way!
I AM NOT EMMA!
Come on, Louis, tell her who the real Emily is...
Wait, I...
That's right, Louis!
I'm fed up with this little game! Tell him who the real Emily is!
Why do these things always happen to me?...
Well?
Louis, come on, you know how to tell us apart, right?!
Yes, yes but I'd like to ask you a few questions, to make sure there is no doubt.
Rational and open, Louis...
Let's see, how can I tell them apart?
Wait, I've got an idea...
On the night of our arrival...
Ask the twin in front
Who was with us?
Who was with us on the wharf?
Cardinal Piaggi.
He was with us from when we started traveling by ship. We arrived on the same boat.
I already told her, Louis...
Another question then?
I'm the one who told you!
What is my job?
You had asked me what had become of me since we last met in London some years before.
What did I answer?
You are an Occultist, Louis.
You told me what happened to you at Hexham Abbey.
That you are a detective, Louis.
You even told me about your adventures regarding some news item...
What were they called now?...
Ah yes! The Chauffeurs d'Orgères!
That you are a Diplomat, Louis.
You even told me about the troubles you had saving some compatriots during the French Revolution.
I already told her, Louis...
I was there!
What happened to me?
On the wharf, something happened to me. What was it?
A malaise. The moment you arrived you felt ill.
And I offered to help while Piaggi went up.
And you turned me down flat.
What did you give me?
You gave me something.
I wasn't feeling very well and you gave me something!
What was it?
My handkerchief...
And you even kept it! It was stained with your blood.
Louis, I already told her. This is all a waste of time...
I'm the one who told YOU!
Ask the twin behind
Who was with us?
Who was with us on the wharf?
Cardinal Piaggi, who couldn't stop talking.
Louis, I already told her about our arrival...
I know because I was there!
The cardinal went up, you felt poorly, Louis, and I offered you my handkerchief!
I was there!
What is my job?
You asked me what had become of me since we last met in London, many years ago.
What did I answer?
You told me that you had become an occultist, Louis.
You know that because I told you!
You even told me about your setbacks at Hexham Abbey, remember?
You told me you had become a Detective, Louis.
You only know that because I told you!
You even told me about your exploits with the thieves who tortured their victims.
What were they called again?...
The Chauffeurs d'Orgères, I think...
You told me you had become a Diplomat, Louis.
You know that because I told you!
Remember, you told me about the difficulty you had saving some British compatriots during the revolution.
I was the one who told you that!
Liar! I was there!
What happened to me?
On the wharf, something happened to me. What happened exactly?
You felt unwell, you had a nose bleed.
And I offered you my handkerchief...
I told her all that already...
It was me who told you!
What did you give me?
You handed me something.
I wasn't feeling very well and you handed me something!
What was it?
My handkerchief...
...and you stained it with your blood.
You still have it, as a matter of fact.
But she already knows all this, Louis. It's a waste of time.
Right, let's find something else...
Ah yes, let's speak about my arrival at the manor!
Question the twin in front
Who was already there at the chimney?
When we arrived at the Manor, someone was already present in the Great Hall.
Who was it?
President Washington!
She knows about this part as well, I'm warning you...
Obviously, I told you!
Who stayed with who?
Once at the Manor, Sir Gregory introduced himself to us then we split up into two groups.
What group was I in?
It won't work, Louis. She knows already, I told her.
Shut up! I'm the one who told you!
You stayed with President Washington and myself, near the chimney...
Because he was freezing and wanted to speak to you about your mother.
You left with Sir Gregory and Cardinal Piaggi.
And you ran into Miss Adams.
I told you she knew.
How did Mortimer welcome us?
On the night of our arrival, we were warming ourselves in front of the fire. Mortimer welcomed us in a very odd way.
What happened?
It won't work, Louis.
It wasn't Mortimer who welcomed us...
It was Sir Gregory.
Sorry, Louis, I already told her.
What did we speak about?
Once we arrived, we stayed together warming ourselves in front of the fire in the Great Hall, with President Washington.
That's right.
What did we talk about?
The President and I revealed to you that we were members of the Order.
You even asked Washington how he met your mother, remember?
Pose a question to Emily behind me.
Who was already by the chimney?
When we arrived at the Manor, someone was already present in the Great Hall. Who was it?
George Washington, President of the United States, Louis.
Of course you are able to reply, I'm the one who told you!
Who stayed with who?
Once at the Manor, we split up into two groups.
What group did I choose?
You stayed with me.
Along with President Washington.
And we informed him that we were members of the Order.
You decided to follow Sir Gregory and Cardinal Piaggi into the small salon.
And he ran into Miss Adams.
Of course you know all this! I'm the one who told you about it!
How did Mortimer welcome us?
On the night of our arrival, we were warming ourselves in front of the fire. Mortimer welcomed us in a certain way.
What happened exactly?
Well played, Louis, unfortunately, I'm not the one you should have asked that question to.
Mortimer did not welcome us.
It was Sir Gregory who welcomed us that night.
Mortimer didn't show up until two days later! I know that as well!
What did we speak about?
Once we'd arrived, we stayed together warming ourselves in front of the fire in the Great Hall, with President Washington.
What did we talk about?
We spoke about your mother.
The President revealed our membership of the Order to you, and that we had everything to gain by trusting one another, Louis.
You remember?
Very well...
Let's try something else...
On the first night... we went up to bed. But I wasn't tired, I went for a little stroll...
Speak to the twin in front
Did we see each other?
Do you remember if we saw each other that night or not?
Not at all.
Of course, how could I forget?
In my room, in fact!
In MY room!
You wanted to spy on Bonaparte's room from the balcony and thought it a great idea to go through mine.
I am sorry for putting that knife to your throat, by the way. I hope I didn't leave any marks.
Did we speak to each other?
Did we get a chance to speak?
Certainly not. I was exhausted and went to bed.
Indeed, we did! Even with a knife at your throat!
And for good reason! You had no business being in my room!
In MY room!
What did you ask me?
The reason why you were in my room, of course.
I asked you if it had anything to do with the Order!
Stop there!
And I advised you to ask for permission next time you wanted to go through my room to spy on Bonaparte.
And I threw you out without ceremony!
Was there anything you reproached me for?
We ran into each other a little later.
The situation in which we talked made you reproach me for something.
What was it?
I did not appreciate you entering my room uninvited.
I would have rather you had come for a different reason than to spy on the room next door...
What did I take from you?
During the night, I had the opportunity of entering your room.
For some reason, I...I couldn't help taking something from you...
An origami...
An origami bird!
Speak to the twin behind.
Did we see each other?
Do you remember if we saw each other that night or not?
No, not after going up to bed.
Of course, Louis. You broke into my room.
That doesn't prove a thing, I was the one who told you that!
Did we speak?
Before going to bed, I went for a stroll.
Did we speak to each other during that stroll?
You must be mistaken. After going up to bed, I went straight to sleep.
A stroll?
Through my room in the middle of the night. You call that a stroll, Louis?
No, I grant you that, I just wanted to make sure.
What did we say to each other at that precise moment in time?
I asked you what you were doing there, what you were playing at on the balcony and if it was anything to do with the Golden Order.
And then?
Then I suggested you first ask permission the next time you wanted to go through my room.
I threw you out!
But she knows all that, Louis, I already told her.
Ask her if I watched her sleep.
Before going to bed, I went through your room.
Do you remember?
How can I forget?
Of course, I told you!
For reasons that only concern yourself, you found it appropriate to stop and watch me sleeping in a state of undress.
I hope the show was worth it.
And I rid you of the desire to renew the experience when, on your way back, I met you with a blade to your throat.
"Never without first being invited."
I already told her, Louis...
What did I take from you?
Finally, I went back through your room before turning in for the night and borrowed something from you.
What did I take from you?
Borrowed?
You are joking! You wanted to steal my origami piece.
MY origami piece!
But I rid you of the desire to do it again.
About the Mars case! You know very well that I still have that message from the killer, which goes to show how much the case obsessed me!
Don't think you're going to get away with this deception so easily!
I can assure you you're going to regret pretending to be me once Louis has exposed you!
Right, I don't think I'll get very far like this....
I have to find something better...
Oh I don't think I'll even wait until he's finished!
Take it easy now!
Are you mad, Louis?
Lower your arm!
I'd better act quickly if I don't want things to get out of hand...
Come on, she's putting one over on you!
Look at yourself, for crying out loud! You are prepared to shoot me down!
In the secret room, behind the study!
Talk to them about what you've been doing, maybe they haven't spoken about it between each other yet...
On the night of the disappearance of Elizabeth Adams!...
What about it?...
What do you want to know about that night?
Ask the one in front.
How did she get past the gorgon?
How did you vanquish the medusa?
The gorgon always attacks the best protected.
The sword kills the monster, the monster charges the shield, the shield reflects the light and the lantern perturbs the monster.
I didn't need more than two minutes to solve that enigma.
That's right! Make fun of us!
Where were we both?
Before going to bed, we found ourselves in an odd situation...
You surprised me searching through Mortimer's secret gallery!
Behind the chimney. You were looking for clues about your mother.
Make her talk about the objects you found
We found ourselves in Mortimer's secret gallery.
What did we find in that room?
A load of old junk that Mortimer had collected.
A so-called Pandora's box in the form of an urn, an old sheep skin that he must take for the golden fleece...
The Bible of Judas, property deeds as old as the hills, and a broken old sword...
You are wasting your time, Louis, she already knows all that...
Of course I do, I was there!
What did she think she found behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it?
A cameo...
Why?
You know very well why!
I want you to tell me...
Why did the cameo move you?
Because I thought it was my sister's!
I was worried sick that something had happened to her and I was running through the manor looking for the bitch when...
Stop lying, Emma!
You know full well the real reason I was there was because of the Al Azif.
Liar! I was there!
I haven't even got a cameo!
What did she think you had found behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it?
A cameo...
Why?
You know very well why!
I want you to tell me...
Why did the cameo move you?
Because I thought it was my sister's!
I was worried sick that something had happened to her and I was running through the manor looking for the bitch when...
Stop lying, Emma!
You know full well the reason why I was there was because of the Al Azif.
Liar!
I haven't even got a cameo!
Ask the the twin behind
How did you get past the gorgon?
Remember...
How did you manage to vanquish the medusa?
Sword toward the gorgon.
Gorgon toward the shield
Shield toward the sword.
Lantern toward the Shield.
Of course, I told her how to do it!
Where were we both?
In the Portrait Gallery, we found ourselves in a singular situation.
What happened to us?
We both went around the Manor all night like sleepwalkers, searching.
And that's how we found ourselves in Mortimer's Private Gallery, behind the chimney.
That doesn't prove a thing, I told you all that!
Make her talk about the objects you found
We found ourselves in Mortimer's secret gallery.
What relics did we find?
Property deeds in Mortimer's name dating from very long ago.
Is that all?
You mean all those mythological charms?
So there was the so-called Pandora's box that wasn't a box, actually.
The famous Golden Fleece that reeked of dead goat.
A broken sword that could have belonged to anyone.
Is that enough?
Yes, that's enough...
You looked captivated.
Of course, he bought it!
What did she think she would find behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
In that gallery, something moved you.
What was it that moved you?
Nothing.
Wrong!
But I do remember picking up the first thing to hand and pretending to be the grieving sister to make you feel sorry for me.
What?...
You bitch! Liar!
What was it again?
A jewel, I think...
You dirty little...
A cameo... it was a cameo.
I made you think it reminded me of my sister's.
In truth I was looking for the Al Azif but I didn't dare tell you.
Shut your trap!
What did she think she would find behind the chimney?
That night, we were in Mortimer's private gallery.
Now in that gallery, something moved you.
What was it that moved you?
Nothing.
Wrong!
But I do remember picking up the first thing to hand and pretending to be the grieving sister to make you feel sorry for me.
What?...
You bitch! Liar!
What was it again?
A jewel, I think...
You dirty little...
A cameo... it was a cameo.
I made you think it reminded me of my sister's.
In truth I was looking for the Al Azif but I didn't dare tell you.
Shut your trap!
That's enough! I've had enough of this charade!
Louis, there's only one way to tell us apart. There's just one thing I didn't tell her about in detail.
Too bad for you, Emma! I didn't want it to come to this but you leave me no choice!
Ask her about you and I.
You just lost, Emma...
I indeed didn't tell you everything about it.
Come, Louis. Speak about our intimacy.
Very well, let's talk about us!
Ask the twin in front
What did we talk about last night?
When you came to my room last night, what did we talk about?
I beg your pardon?
But...
I didn't go into your room last night.
There you are, the mask is off...
What do you mean?
Sorry, Emma, I didn't tell you everything.
She's right.
You little bitch!
She is manipulating you, Louis...
What was the reason for your visit last night?
Last night, you came to visit me and I can't help wondering why.
Why did you come to my room?
Louis, you must be mistaken. I did not go to your room last night.
And that's where your little game ends, Emma.
Because I never told you about it.
So, there, you can't answer.
Wha...
No, you didn't do that?!
I didn't want you to be jealous of Louis!
Remember how you always used to react whenever you felt you were competing against a man.
You dirty...
That's enough! I've had enough of this charade!
Why spend the night together last night?
Last night, we spent the night together. But beforehand, you insisted on talking about my choices during the conference.
Why?
I beg your pardon?
Louis, I did not go to see you last night...
Wh... Huh?
Now your true identity is exposed.

You little...
See, Louis, she didn't know that we'd seen each other last night! I never told her about it.

Louis, it's embarrassing. You know full well what I did last night.
I want to hear you say it.
We spent it together, of course.
What?
I came to your room after the conference and excuse me if I don't go into the details but I was mightily impressed.
What did you do?
Look how you are reacting, Emma! It's not surprising I didn't tell you about my night with Louis.
You slut!
Oh, it was hardly my finest hour, now you're embarrassing me.
I'm sorry but I need to know.
I came to see you to spend the rest of the night with you but you were tired and preferred to decline my invitation.
What did you do?
I know, I never spoke to you about it.
But judging by your reaction, it was just as well. And Louis did not succumb to my charms anyway.
You slut!
That's enough, both of you!
Now I know who the real Emily is!
EMILY IS OPPOSITE YOU
It's you, Emily...
No, Louis! She is manipulating you!
No, Emma. It's her, I know it.
Despite all the trouble you've gone to to put one over on me, I know it is her.
That's enough now, Emma!
You little slut!
Don't think you are going to get away with this so easily!
You are going to stop your little game right now!
Never! I am Duchess Hillsb...
No!
Emily?
I am the duchess...
But...
You don't...
I...
Dear God, what have I done?
See what you've done?
See?...
Louis?
What on earth is...
Mother!
Go away!
You must go! Everyone is going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Come on, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I am coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
EMILY IS BEHIND YOU
You are Emily Hillsborrow.
I knew you wouldn't get it wrong, Louis.
No! You little bitch!
Watch out, Louis!
No!!
Hell, what have I done?
See what you've done?
See?
Louis?
What on earth is going...
Mother!
Go!
You must leave! Everyone's going to arrive.
Louis, what's going on?
Duchess?
Is everything alright?
Go! Go, Mother!
No one must find you here!
Go!
Come, Louis!
There's nothing more you can do...
But I...
Leave us...
Emily? What's going on?
Mother, go to the crypt! I'll meet you there!
I'll be waiting for you!
Emily...
Madam, I'm coming in!
It was bound to end like this, Louis.
Let me stay with her, please.
Go, I'll cover you.
What? What are you doing there?
Stop!
Goddammit! Now what's going on?
I do believe that's Emily's voice...
Listen at the door
I can't understand what she's saying !
Knock at the door
Emily! Emily, are you there?...  Answer me!...  Emily?
Try to open the door
Try to pick the lock.
I can't open it...  It must be blocked on the other side! I'll have to find another way in quick!
Try to force open the door.
Impossible!   I can't do it, there's something blocking it on the other side!   I've got to find another way in!
Go back
Move away
I do believe that's Emily's voice...
Listen at the door
I can't understand what she's saying !
Knock at the door
Emily! Emily, are you there?...  Answer me!...  Emily?
Try to open the door
Try to pick the lock.
I can't open it...  It must be blocked on the other side! I'll have to find another way in quick!
Try to force open the door.
Impossible!   I can't do it, there's something blocking it on the other side!   I've got to find another way in!
Go back
Move away
Did you hear that, I was not dreaming, was I?
Certainly not, Duke Godoy.
What's going on?
Someone heard a bang coming from the Duchess' room and she isn't answering.
Gentlemen, go back to your rooms.
Go back to...
your...
rooms!
I shall find out from Lord Mortimer what this is all about...
Thank you...
Knock at the door
No answer... 
Insist
Nothing... 
Insist again
Emily?
Emily, are you there?
Leave it
Knock at the door
No answer... 
Insist
Nothing... 
Insist again
Emily?
Emily, are you there?
Leave it
Emily...
Yes...  Louis, is that you?
Yes, let me in...
I...
I'm sorry, Louis...
I don't feel very well. I'll see you later...
Are you sure everything's all right?
...
Are you still there?
How could you do that to me?
You're a fine one to talk! Once again, you're the one who's the victim in all this!
What are you on about now?
I should never have told you what happened to me!
That's how it works and you know it full well! I'm not that naive!
I know you inside out!
Stop! We'll end up losing everything if you keep on!
It's as if there are several people inside... 
It's as if there are several people inside... 
My friends...
I don't understand... I spoke to him only recently...
Monsieur Péru has lost his mind, it's obvious!
Yet another way for the French to make a spectacle of themselves! Well, once again, it has worked!
My friends, let us settle down, please...
We are all in shock, of course...
Let us praise Louis' gesture anyway...
You did what you could...
Yes, it was very noble of you, Louis.
It wasn't your fault...
There was nothing else you could have done...
Let us celebrate Louis' courage, he enabled us to avert a tragedy!
Yes, that was very noble of you, Louis.
You have given us all a fine lesson in courage!
I... Thank you...
He owes you his life, that's quite something!
That madman deserves to die!
We are providing Monsieur Péru with care, but rest assured, he's no longer a danger to himself, or anyone else for that matter.
It's absolutely incomprehensible...
As you say...
No idea what he could have blamed himself for, but the poor man was literally racked with remorse.
What a pity he did not seek the mercy of the Lord...
He is forever damned, now...
I think everyone needs a little rest...
Can you stay a moment?
Of course...
Louis?
Louis? Are you awake?
Ah! It looks like he's coming around...
You gave us a mighty fright, sir.
A veritable force of nature!
It's hard to believe, isn't it...
That's Sarah's boy all right.
Slowly, Louis. Take your time.
I... Mr President?...
I... I've got... I've got a bad...
Careful, you haven't fully recovered...
You've had rather a close call Louis!
We're all relieved to see you back with us...
My friends, this is a great relief to us all..
But please, let Louis recover now...
Monsieur de Richet, we have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but I hope you will soon be back on your feet so we can rectify that.
Allow me to introduce myself...
Manuel Godoy, Duke of Alcudia and Head of the Spanish government.
Godoy... He... he's the one Mother spoke about giving a present to in her letter. The one found on the wharf.
Very... Very honored, sir...
Now, let us leave him to rest.
See you later. Get some rest.
Louis?
Louis? Are you awake?
Ah! It looks like he's coming around...
You gave us a mighty fright, sir.
A veritable force of nature!
It's hard to believe, isn't it...
That's Sarah's boy all right.
Slowly, Louis. Take your time.
I... Mr President?...
I... I've got... I've got a bad...
Careful, you haven't fully recovered...
You've had rather a close call Louis!
We're all relieved to see you back with us...
My friends, this is a great relief to us all..
But please, let Louis recover now...
Monsieur de Richet, we have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but I hope you will soon be back on your feet so we can rectify that.
Allow me to introduce myself...
Manuel Godoy, Duke of Alcudia and Head of the Spanish government.
Godoy... He... he's the one Mother spoke about giving a present to in her letter. The one found on the wharf.
Very... Very honored, sir...
Now, let us leave him to rest.
See you later. Get some rest.
Oh Louis!...  one more thing, please.
I wanted to thank you for your support during the conference.
You've made the right choice and it gives me tremendous satisfaction to have you with me on this project.
It's worth it
What is at stake is worth it, my Lord.
Now I won't hide from you the fact that I have no idea by what miracle we could ever get a unanimous vote.
We shall lose
And much good may it do you, my Lord.
But look at the voters. It needs to be unanimous.
And we just lost Péru.
The battle is already lost, if you ask me.
Trust me, Louis.
We still have a few more cards to play, you'll see.
Anything can happen in politics.
What a pity you didn't support me during the conference.
I hope I can count on you on the day of the vote.
This major project needs men like you, Louis!
Thank you, but no
I am flattered, my Lord, but I don't know what could possibly make me change my mind.
Please, don't refuse me my last hope... 
Don't mix hope with illusion, my Lord.
And you, illusion with strategy, my friend.
You win, I'll let you have the last word.
I'll think about it
And you never know, right?...  Maybe by then I'll see things differently.
Well, thank you for allowing me to believe in that possibility, Louis.
From here on, I shall make it my mission to persuade you to change your vote.
Be my guest.
But I hope your arguments are very very persuasive, because I'm not the only one who isn't on your side.
Oh, rest assured. I am working on it!
Very well, then.
I'll see you later, my Lord.
Louis, I wanted to thank you personally.
I admire what you did to save Monsieur Péru's life.
You have given us all a wonderful lesson in courage.
Don't mention it, my Lord...
You would have done the same. I was just quicker.
Ah, humility is a fine quality, sir.
Where is he now?
In his room. I've sedated him. I don't want him trying to take his life again.
Or worse yet, attacking one of the guests. When in despair, Monsieur Péru is clearly a dangerous man.
Why did he want to commit suicide?
In your opinion, why did he want to commit suicide?
Well, I'm afraid with the passing years, he could no longer carry the burden of his actions during the French Revolution.
What do you mean?
Do you know his reputation?
Not really, I must admit.
Well, Jacques Péru is considered to be one of the most ruthless judges of the revolutionary tribunal of Paris.
If by misfortune he was the one on your case, you had nine chances out of ten of ending up on the scaffold...
Or else tortured at Petit Chatelet until your execution day...
In that case, why did you support him?
Through loyalty. I am not in the habit of abandoning my allies.
At the beginning, he firmly supported the Convention by ensuring that the Nobility could not escape their destiny.
The purging of the Noble blood...
It is unfortunate but often necessary for change, Louis.
We had to ensure that the Old Regime would never return to power, without which all our efforts would have been in vain.
I was expecting as much.
I knew he did some bad things, but not to that extent.
We talked together the other day.
What did he tell you?
He had said goodbye to his daughter
I had surprised him writing a goodbye letter to his daughter.
Oh! Péru had a daughter?
You didn't know?
Not at all.
Well, Apparently, his intention was to send her to an orphanage.
Nothing very specific
He didn't go into detail but...
I was given to understand that his position, and therefore his life, had become pretty much unbearable.
I should have known...
Over time, the position of judge can slowly gnaw away at you, if you are not careful.
What do you mean?
You end up blaming the whole world, and take it out on the first person to step in your way.
Criminals literally getting away with murder, lawyers always playing with the law...
You end up feeling out of your depth.
It would seem so, indeed...
Be wary of Mortimer
To tell the truth, he told me to be careful of you.
Of me? Why...  why is that?
He said you were...  you were the devil...
Well, doesn't that just take the cake!
For years I've been striving to support and encourage his career, and now look what he says about me.
What ingratitude!
Did he tell you why he thought that about me?
Yes
You apparently charmed, flattered and pushed him.
That's not entirely untrue, but how is that a crime?
By following you, he became lost, to the point where he was no longer able to recognize, nor bear himself.
No
Not in the slightest, my Lord.
His speech was very incoherent.
Oh...  Well, I'm...  I'm saddened by what you say.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of such news.
Don't be, Louis.
It isn't your fault.
That you are apparently testing me.
According to him, you're apparently testing me.
Testing you?
What the devil for?
I don't know.
He implied that you would move heaven and earth to charm me into serving you.
Frankly, Louis, I'm probably not the best person to reply to these allegations.
But I can't see why I would be moving mountains to please you.
I did not meet you on the evening of your arrival.
I unfortunately have not been able to find your mother.
You have even been accused of murder!
I can assure you if my intention was to charm you, as you say, I would have presented myself in a much more favorable light.
Why was he terrified of Mortimer?
Tell me, my Lord...
Can you think of any reason why he would be so terrified of you?
Terrified? Come now, that's a bit harsh...
I think he was simply unable to put things into perspective.
I see no reason to fear me. Ask President Washington, I don't believe I'm such a "difficult" friend.
Having spoken to him, I can assure you that he feared you even more than death itself.
Had he disappointed you in any way recently?
Of course, he was on the edge. He was desperate and it grew noticeable in his work.
Our collaboration was probably coming to an end, but I certainly didn't feel the need to threaten him, ever.
But without you, no more support, no more money. It was an end to his social status.
If you lost, he lost everything, didn't he?
No, not his life.
Thanks to me, I guess...
Why did you invite him?
Tell me, my Lord...
What did you expect of him exactly?
I found it difficult to understand what his role was here.
In fact, I asked him here to speak about our collaboration.
His mission was soon to come to an end and I was hoping to persuade him to slow down...
I had a few interesting missions abroad to propose to him.
Did you tell him that?
I just let him know that perhaps it was time to move on to something else.
On that note, my Lord, I'll be leaving you.
Have we covered everything?
Absolutely.
I wanted to see you to apologize for all these events... 
I am absolutely bowled over by what has just happened.
Who would have thought that Monsieur Péru would have taken his own life like that?
I'm not excusing what he did!
I don't know.
We weren't inside his mind.
Of course.
Oh, I did notice that he seemed to have a lot on his mind since he arrived here... 
The burden of his position, the difficult political atmosphere in Paris, but never did I think he would go to such an extreme... 
He could have asked for help.
No one held his hand when he pulled the trigger.
We cannot blame ourselves, despite the gravity of the act.
I admit that I did have serious doubts about him of late.
I found him wary and distant.
After such an act, I agree it is difficult to say whether or not he had all his mental faculties.
His fate doesn't really concern me
To be honest, my Lord, I would not have risked my life for his, and his death doesn't really concern me.
I understand.
You didn't really know him.
I can't help but wonder what could have pushed him into doing it.
We shall never know, my Lord.
(Lie) There was nothing I could do
I hate myself for not being able to intervene... 
Unfortunately, he surprised us all.
Of course... 
Don't blame yourself...  we couldn't know what he had planned.
It was to be expected.
Oh there were a few warning signs.
From having talked to him, I knew he was desperate. Without guidance, disappointed with his life... 
Oh really?
What did he tell you?
He had said goodbye to his daughter.
Well, I had surprised him writing a goodbye letter to his daughter.
Péru had a daughter?
You didn't know?
No, no, not at all.
Apparently, his intention was to send her to an orphanage
Nothing very specific
He didn't go into the details... 
But I was given to understand that his position, and indeed his life, had become unbearable.
I should have known... 
The role of judge, in the long run, can gnaw away at you slowly if you are not careful.
You end up blaming the whole world, and take it out on the first person who steps in your way.
Criminals getting away with murder, lawyers always playing with the law.
You can lose your bearings somewhat.
It would seem so, I suppose... 
Warn me against Mortimer
He told me to beware of you, to be honest.
Of me? Why is that?
He said you were the... the devil... 
Well, doesn't that just take the cake!
For years I've been striving to support and encourage his career and now look at how he repays me.
What ingratitude!
Did he tell you why he thought that about me?
Yes
You apparently charmed, flattered, pushed him.
That's not entirely untrue, but how is that a crime?
By following you, he became lost...  to the extend of neither being able to recognize, nor bear himself.
No
No, he didn't, my Lord.
His speech was very disorganized.
Oh, I... I'm saddened by what you say.
I am sorry to be the bearer of such news.
Don't be, Louis.
It isn't your fault.
That you are apparently testing me
According to him, you are apparently testing me.
Testing you, Louis?
What the devil for?
I don't know.
You would apparently move heaven and earth to try and charm me into serving you.
Well, frankly, Louis, it's not for me to reply to these allegations.
But I can't see why I would be moving mountains to please you.
I did not meet you on the evening of your arrival.
I unfortunately, have not been able to find your mother.
You were even accused of murder!
I can assure you if I wanted to charm you, as you say, I would have presented myself in a much more favorable light.
On that note, my Lord, I'll be leaving you.
Have we covered everything?
Absolutely.
Louis, I wanted to talk to you a moment about what has happened.
All this is tragic but I wanted to thank you for doing what you could... 
I wasn't able to save him... 
You couldn't, Louis. You mustn't blame yourself.
It is not your fault.
Yes, you are right
Of course but... 
I thought I could help him.
I guess it was too late.
Don't torture yourself. Look what you've done... 
I admire what you did... 
Who else among all these great luminaries of the modern world even raised a finger?
No one. You were the only one who tried to do anything.
I knew this would happen
I could have anticipated this, I... 
I spoke to him the day before and I should have seen he was in...  well, in a bad way... 
But I'm guessing he refused your help... 
I...  yes... 
You see, you can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved... 
We talked, I...  I should have taken it a little more seriously... 
What about?
Nothing in particular
He remained evasive but I think his work had become too much of a burden for him... 
I certainly overestimated his strength... 
What do you mean by that?
Over time, his duties as a judge must have hugely weakened him... 
As he said so himself.
Indeed... 
He told me to beware of you, my Lord
He told me he had the same feelings of remorse as those he mentioned before...  his act... 
And he warned me against you and your influence.
Against me?
Why is that? I did everything within my power to promote him, I helped him, funded him, supported him... 
I always believed in him... 
He blames you for leading him in a direction he now regrets.
Blaming me for that is to duck his own responsibility!
What you tell me is terribly unjust, Louis.
He was not a child.
Did he say I forced him?
No... 
Is it your fault, Mortimer?
I know this has nothing to do with me, my Lord.
But don't you think you're partly to blame?
It won't escape your attention that he incriminated you before he took his own life... 
I heard what he said, yes.
Monsieur Péru appeared to blame me for his condition.
I certainly encouraged him to succeed, but I wasn't aware he couldn't handle the pressures of the situation.
Of course, his duties in Paris were very difficult.
The choices he had to make were burdensome, but that was the path he had chosen.
Should I not have helped him to succeed perhaps?
You heard him yourself... 
His duties as judge got the better of him.
Did you push him into it?
I wouldn't say "push", but I did encourage him, yes.
I thought it was my duty to help him as much as I could, to become the court judge he dreamed of being.
I thought he was capable of it.
It appears I was mistaken, unfortunately.
What a pity he didn't come and speak to me.
He did.
What do you mean?
He went to talk to you in your study, the day before yesterday.
Unfortunately, you weren't there.
I was not informed of this.
What a waste... 
What are your plans now?
What do you mean?
For the conference.
After the disappearances of both Elizabeth Adams and my mother...  And now the death of Monsieur Péru.
I should imagine that your guests are all packing their bags.
This might come as a bit of a shock to you... 
Perhaps because it was so difficult to bring all these figures together, but I am convinced that none of them is preparing to leave.
What do you mean?
Are you serious?
They are all very experienced politicians... 
And though they are of course affected by the situation, they know full well that such an opportunity will not come again for a long long time, if ever!
They each represent their nation and know full well that what is at stake here is far greater than the death of poor Monsieur Péru.
You'll see, I am confidant that they will all be ready to resume the conference.
But that is immoral!
And you endorse that?
For god's sake, that's totally immoral!
Morality and politics don't go well together, my boy.
Like water and oil, they cannot mix.
By definition, politics is not immoral as much as it is amoral.
It must not take into account any morality that would constitute a hindrance. Otherwise it could not be free to make tough decisions.
Do you realize what you just said?
It's a question of duty, Louis.
Look, morality evolves over time, and differs depending on the habits and customs of each country. It must not be a criterion.
What we are doing here, Louis, will change the very face of the World.
I'm not saying it's easy, but it is our duty.
The future is in motion and nothing must stop it.
If you say so... 
Allow me to take my leave, please.
Of course.
You ought to get some rest... 
We thought that bastard Péru had taken you out as well.
Me too?
What do you mean by "me as well"?
Péru is the one who assassinated Miss Adams.
We found his footprint at the scene of the crime.
What do you mean?
What? He's the one who shot at me?
Yes, indeed. At point blank range!
It's a miracle you survived.
The scoundrel tried to pass your murder off as the result of your meeting with Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory.
It seemed like things hadn't gone very well for you...So, that sly fox tried to make Mortimer believe that he thought the sentence was death anyway.
Thankfully, Mortimer is not an easy man to fool.
Elizabeth, she...
It's... it's over, Louis.
Get your strength back...
Has my mother reappeared?
Alas, no... I'm sorry.
But I've been doing a little investigating while you were recovering...
What do you mean?
Say nothing
I've found out that your mother kept in touch with Emily's twin sister, Emma, who was on the island before we arrived.
Between them, they have hidden a book on the island...
Emily and her... her sister were twins?...
Yes, they share the same identity, very handy for a spy.
But keep it to yourself, it's their most closely guarded secret and for Emily it's no joking matter.
Well, Emily must have been pleased to be with her sister, though.
Unfortunately not.
I hadn't finished.
The day you arrived on the island, your mother apparently shot Emma.
What?...
What on earth is this all about?
I'd better warn you: the reasons are very obscure but Sir Gregory witnessed the scene.
My vision was real then! I had it at the same time as the altercation!
What's... what's happening here, Mr President?
How long exactly have I been bedridden?
For nearly two days... We started the conference without you or Sarah, of course...
What do you mean?
Say nothing
Yes... Lord Mortimer brought us together in his usual fashion to propose that we partake in a major project.
This time he and Sir Gregory were against each other over the fate of Louisiana: Lord Mortimer wanted Spain to cede it to France.
The ultimate aim being to double the territory of the United States, so creating the biggest democratic state in the world!
Just think of the shear scope of the idea, Louis!
I... yes... but I... I guess I didn't realize that decisions like that were made in this way.
As your mother supported Lord Mortimer, you were announced as her substitute, on Lord Mortimer's side for the time being.
You'll be able to position yourself as you please within the next two days, the final vote won't be held before that.
If... if only I had anticipated this...
All of this in only two days... you haven't been idle, that's for sure...
Poor Elizabeth... I... I still don't understand...
Yes, I share your feelings.
And I still don't know how I'm going to tell her father.
Thank you for all the information, Mr President.
You're welcome, Louis.
I'll get you a nice cup of herbal tea, it'll do you good.
I'll see you shortly...
We thought that bastard Péru had taken you out as well.
Me too?
What do you mean by "me as well"?
Péru is the one who assassinated Miss Adams.
We found his footprint at the scene of the crime.

I'll get you a nice cup of herbal tea, it'll do you good.
I'll see you shortly...
Slowly now...
It's a miracle that you are still alive, so let's not force it...
Yes... don't worry...
The bastard really let me have it...
You have given us a fine lesson in courage, Louis.
Can't say it's done you much good...but still, not everyone would have done it.
What...what's happened to Péru?
He has withdrawn into silence.
Lord Mortimer gave him something to calm him down and let's just say it was a healthy dose.
He is locked in his room in a nearly catatonic state.
We can't exactly say it's good for our business, Louis.
What do you mean?
We just lost a vote for Mortimer's cause at the conference...
I must admit that's not the first thing that came into my mind.
Don't get me wrong... It's not that I am indifferent to Péru's personal tragedy.
But I simply can't forget the interests of my Nation.
All is not lost... I have faith that Mortimer will find a solution.
And I'm certain it won't be long before he lets us know what it is...
Of course Mortimer is less than happy about it.
...meaning?
Well, it's one less vote for the conference.
You know my position.
I'm not gonna cry about it.
But join us, I'm sure that Sir Gregory would be delighted to have you aboard.
You never give up, do you...
You're the one who brought the subject up, Mr President.
To the great displeasure of Mortimer, apparently.
Why is that?
Well, it's one less vote at the conference.
You see, you did well in joining us.
Did you know something would happen to Péru?
Louis...
If you had known, you would have told me, wouldn't you?
No, Mr President, getting shot at wasn't part of my plans.
For once, things have turned out better than expected, so let's make the most of it.
What would you say to a cup of herbal tea?
It'll do you a world of good.
With pleasure...
Good God! They're all here...
They must have heard the gunshot...
Where is Lord Mortimer?
Can anyone hear anything through the door?
Good God! They're all here...
They must have heard the gunshot...
Where is Lord Mortimer?

Next time I'll listen to my mother.
Not a day has gone by without something happening to me.
What now... 
Next time I'll listen to my mother.
Not a day has gone by without something happening to me.
What now... 
I'll see you later, Louis.
Damnit! It's closed!
Seems like the key is still in the lock on the other side.
That means I won't be able to pick it... 
Or, I could do as I did the last time in the Tower Room.
Use the key
I must act fast... 
Look at the gap between the door and the floor.
Slip a card underneath the door
Perfect! This card should do the trick!
Look at the gap
I wonder if I can get the key by pushing something underneath and making it fall.
Pull back the paper
Use the magnet to recover the key
Go back
Force the door open
Looks like I've got no choice, here...  Let's try brute force and ignorance!
Look at the lock
Pick the lock
Shit! The key on the other side is stopping me from unlocking the door!
Make the key fall
Slowly, Louis...  nice and slow... 
Let's have a little look at the lock 
It's not a very complex lock. I'm sure I can force it if I can just find something to smash it with.
Smash the lock with the sword
Slowly. Easy does it... 
Go back
Move away

Monsieur Bonaparte...
Louis, once again: bravo for what you did.
If it weren't for you, Péru would have blown his brains out!
You've got courage.  I like this!
Don't feel guilty over Monsieur Péru, you did your best.
Yes, Louis... What do you want?
Let's get to the point, I have to study our different possibilities for turning the vote in our favor.
We just lost a vote for the next conference, and we already had fewer votes than Holm.
I must absolutely find a solution.
To hell with the conference
Excuse me, sir, but given recent events, I find it somewhat cavalier to return to your political preoccupations so quickly...
Yes, yes, I know, you must find me inhumane, but what can I do?
We are here to decide upon the fate of our nations, Louis!
It is time you realize what is at stake here...
I hold nothing against Monsieur Péru personally, but what concerns me most right now is to not lose sight of the objectives of this meeting.
The conference comes first
Yes, yes indeed...
But I believe if Lord Mortimer is still confident, it's because he still has a few cards up his sleeve...
I hope so...  I sincerely hope so...
Given your failure to convince Godoy, it's going to take a bit more than luck!
You should have gone yourself then, if you think you coud have done better!
Unfortunately, that vote of Godoy you acquired is probably not going to suffice.
Well, it's still more than what you've done, isn't it?
I see you have a short fuse, monsieur!
As someone who just started a war with Spain, if I were you, I wouldn't get on my high horse so quickly.
In short, we haven't a minute to lose.
I'll leave you now.
Just a minute.
Speak to him about Emily
Can you tell me what Duchess Hillsborrow proposed to you on the night of the conference?
I was sure you'd ask me that...
Not that I hold the Duchess dear to my heart, but I do nevertheless have some scruples.
I have noticed you hovering around her since you arrived, and I only have one piece of advice to give you:
Don't forget why she came here and don't delude yourself.
That makes two pieces of advice.
Ah, how you love having the last word...
Well, I'll leave you now.
See you later, sir.
What was Emily after on the night of the conference.
Why did Duchess Hillsborrow go and see you last night?
Ah, I see that it bothers you not to know.
I've half a mind to send you on a wild goose chase...
The Duchess simply came to persuade me to change sides.
But rest assured, with the most honorable intentions.
What did Emily propose on the night of the conference?
What did Duchess Hillsborrow propose last night?
Oh, nothing worth worrying about.
The pretty little pudding-eater found no better tactic than to threaten me.
She would have been better off sliding into my bed, at least we wouldn't have wasted part of the night talking for nothing.
Threatened?
Threatened you, you say?
That's what I said...
I think I'm going to have to be careful of English troops crisscrossing the Mediterranean for a while.
The witch would let loose the wrath of the English Crown on my august person.
But if she thinks that would scare a Bonaparte, she is mistaken!
Shut your hole, you swine!
Shut up! Or I will not hesitate to make you eat your words!
Louis, you really must learn to conceal your weaknesses better...  if you don't want your foes to use them against you.
In our profession, it's dangerous to show any vulnerability...
Anyway...  Don't worry about last night. The discussion between the duchess and myself was innocent and conducted with only the most honorable intentions.
Now, Louis. Time is running short and as I said, I'm in a hurry.
I have to go now. I will see you later.
Sorry de Richet, I have no time for traitors such as yourself.
I beg your pardon?
If you are here, it's because Lord Mortimer agreed to include you.
And what's the first thing that you do?
You betray him by following Sir Gregory and bending over backwards to turn Washington against him.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I was free to vote as I pleased.
I didn't realize I had to vote for Lord Mortimer in order to show my gratitude toward him...
Hey, he invited me here to come and look for my missing mother during his high-society party!
I'm sorry, truly sorry, I don't know all your customs yet!
It's just common decency that, when invited to a man's castle, you don't go and to pee on his boots.
Is it too much to ask?
I guess it is.
I already mentioned it yesterday...  either to you or to someone else, impossible to tell with you people!
Yes, sir.
Your "yes" is not sufficient...  Tell the others, for crying out loud!
Remember to close my window once you've done my room!
This isn't Corsica, you know, I'm freezing!
Of course, sir.
I'll see to it straight away.
Good, proceed.
Yes, sir.
Examine the sword
Napoleon's sword... 
Take the sword
This sword is well-made.
I should be able to force the lock with it.
Go back

Speak to him
Monsieur Péru?
...  (inaudible)
Monsieur?
...  (inaudible)
Oh man...  I don't know what Mortimer has given him but he's not looking all there.
Examine him
He is in a catatonic state.
Observe him
I wonder what can have done this to him...
I know Lord Mortimer gave him something but even the strongest opiates don't have this effect.
It's as if his body is no longer responding.
Check him over
Pupils totally dilated and unresponsive.
Pulse extremely slow and faint.
No reaction to any stimuli. It's the first time I've come across something like this.
I don't even know how he is able to stay seated.
Analyze him
I've seen patients after a major trauma before but, but nothing like this.
Mortimer has spared no effort to "calm" him down.
Go back
Search his pockets
Let's see what he has on him...
Leave him
Speak to him
Monsieur Péru?

Excuse me, my son, but I would like a few moments to gather my thoughts.
We shall perhaps meet later...
Your Eminence...
Ah, Louis!
Well done, my son!
You may well have saved our lives. Who knows what that madman was capable of?
It was a reflex reaction.
And modest as well.
Sarah would be proud of you.
You were admirable...
You didn't manage to save Péru but whatever you do, don't blame yourself. You did your best.
I...  Thank you, your Eminence.
What a disturbing turn of events!
What just happened is terrible. Who could have guessed that Monsieur Péru was in such a bad way?
No one, your Eminence.
No one...
Ah...It's not going to help matters for Mortimer. Now he has one less vote for the conference.
He doesn't look too put out, though
You don't seem too affected by it, though.
Louis, I do not appreciate your remark, which I will put down to the indiscretions of youth.
I am here in the interests of the Holy Seat, but I am above all a christian and it hurts me to see lost souls take a wrong turn.
Of course, of course...
The bugger hasn't lost sight of his interests
Ah! I see his Eminence is able to identify a good opportunity in every situation.
Now what do you expect, Louis?
The benefit of age. You'll see, you'll learn with time.
Except if I find it disgusting...
Indeed, a tough blow for Mortimer.
What do you expect?
Mortimer has chosen his supporters.
Maybe he should have chosen more carefully.
But even with such a setback, I'd still be wary of Mortimer.
I sense he has still a few surprises in store for us.
Oh, I fully agree with you.
I learned about your failure with Washington.
I did my best. The President is a shrewd diplomat.
It was perhaps too early to send you to the front line of the battle.
Mah, don't blame yourself.
Anyway, I am tired.
If you don't mind, I shall retire to my bed.
By all means, your Eminence.
I've been told about Washington.
Congratulations, Louis. I must admit, though, when I first saw you, I would never have put money on you succeeding.
Well, I was wrong!
Thank you, your Eminence.
On that note, I shall leave you, Louis.
I'll see you later.
I hope that Monsieur Péru's act will help you reconsider your choice, Louis...  sincerely.
See where his support for Lord Mortimer got him...
Mock him over Godoy
As for you, your Eminence, I'd advise you to be wary of your allies.
Come, Louis, I am past the age of being influenced by simple posturing.
I am tired now, let us resume our discussion later, if you don't mind.
As you please, your Eminence...
Beware of Godoy
Godoy betrayed you.
He has turned his back on you and will follow Mortimer.
What? Are you joking?
You can always join us, your Eminence.
Don't be the butt of the joke.
When all your so-called allies have changed sides without warning, you'll be a laughing stock...
I don't know what you are talking about, Louis.
Please excuse me, but I am tired, we shall resume our discussion later perhaps...
As you please, your Eminence...
Say nothing
And what will your mother say when she finds out that you have triggered a war with your amateur diplomacy.
This cannot be serious, really.
Thank you for your advice, your Eminence...
Think nothing of it, Louis.
See you later.
Your Eminence...
Ah, Louis!
Well done, my son!

I am sorry, sir, but you're unable to access Mr Péru's room while we gather his personal effects.
My instructions are clear, Sir. No one is to enter.
Sorry, sir, but you cannot go through.
We have very clear instructions from Lord Mortimer.
Mr Péru must rest.
Mr President?
No answer...  He isn't in his room right now.
Mr President?
No answer...  He isn't in his room right now.
Louis, open up, please.
Coming, Mr President, I'm coming.
Louis! There you are at last!
Yes, I...
I just saw your mother. She was accompanied by Emily and they both went into the Duchess' room!
I tried to join them but I was refused entry!
Louis, this does not bode well...
Oh, shit... Emily might want to avenge her sister! I must act quickly!
You are right, Mr President.
Thank you!
Louis, open up, please.
Coming, Mr President, I'm coming.

You are right, Mr President.
Thank you!
Congratulations Monsieur de Richet, you made the right decision at the conference.
What can I do for you?
Speak to him about Péru's behavior.
I was wondering if you could spare me a moment.
I'd like to speak about what happened to Monsieur Péru...
And I, Monsieur, would rather not.
Frankly, I believe that he more than deserved his fate.
Don't expect me to feel sorry for him.
That's a personal remark...
You seem to have taken a personal stance.
Am I wrong?
What do you mean?
How could you possibly say something like that?
Don't insist
Ever since I found out that traces incriminating him were found next to Elizabeth's body...
You can be sure that given the opportunity, I would have put a bullet in his mouth myself!
Any news of the Al Azif?
Do you have any news regarding your search for the Al Azif?
Aha, good, you are straight to the point this time. I appreciate that.
I shall allow myself to reply only because we are now on the same side. But keep it to yourself.
My search is over. We have it!
What?
You mean you... you've found it?
Sorry, Louis. We were quicker than you.
But I can't really talk about it.
In any case, that's one good thing out of the way.
Where was it?
Congratulations, you... you were quicker than me!
Oh, don't blame yourself, you had no chance of getting the better of Sir Gregory.
Well, at least I tried.
So, tell me, where did you find it?
Would you believe that your mother gave it to Emily's twin sister before we arrived on the island.
Apparently, she asked her to hide it and once she had done so, your mother intended to kill her.
But Emma, Emily's sister, survived. Sir Gregory realized this and hid her in his apartment to tend to her without anyone knowing.
When she came around, Emma rallied to Sir Gregory and told him where the Al Azif was.
And that was it.
That's one good thing done and dusted!
Notice something
Is anything wrong?
Oh well, if I were you, Louis, I would be careful.
Emma is still alive and when your mother turns up, I wouldn't be surprised if she considers she has a score to settle with her.
You're right, it's quite probable.
I think that Sir Gregory will do all he can to calm the situation down but there's no guaranteeing that she won't find a way of taking her revenge on your mother.
However, keep it to yourself. We never spoke to each other.
(default)
Thank you for this information, sir.
Oh, don't mention it, Louis. It's natural, we are playing on the same side now.
You can always count on me.
On that note, I don't want to take up any more of your time.
Oh, not at all, Louis.
Come back whenever you want.
I'll see you later.
Leave
Excuse me, wrong room.
What do you want from me, de Richet?
Get on with it. I'm busy.
Speak to him about the conference.
I wanted to speak to you about the conference...
Listen, you chose your side.
You had every possible reason to make the right choice, but you preferred to commit yourself to Mortimer.
Good luck because it's a lost battle.
The subject is closed. Anything else?
Speak to him about Péru's behavior.
What a tragedy about Monsieur Péru.
Are you joking?
That bonehead had it coming to him!
That's a personal remark...
You seem to have taken a personal stance.
Am I wrong?
What do you mean?
How can you say that?
Don't insist
Ever since I found out that footprints incriminating him were found next to Elizabeth's body...
You can be sure that given the opportunity, I would have put a bullet in his mouth myself!
Any news of the Al Azif?
As I was passing by your room, I wondered if you'd made any progress with your search for the Al Azif...
Hmm... Do you remember our little discussion last time, de Richet?
Indeed, I do.
So please go straight to hell and stop wasting my time.
Leave
Excuse me, this is the wrong room.
Come on, for Christ's sake, Péru! Wake up!
Louis, do you want something?
Only to pass through
Oh, don't bother yourself for me.
I'm just passing through.
Oh please, feel free.
Right, now it's just the two of us...
I am sure you know his little secrets!
You have been a good doggy all these years, so you must know where he hides his little secrets!
What did he do?
Am I disturbing you perhaps?
Why, not at all.
Now we are on the same side, Louis.
How can I help?
What were you doing with Péru?
Tell me, what were you two doing?
I'm trying to get some sense out of this vegetable but I'm afraid Mortimer's over-sedated him.
He can't even speak.
But I'm not beaten yet, I'm sure he will end up telling me everything he knows and especially where Mortimer's hideout is.
The manor must be riddled with secret rooms and I'm sure that Péru knows some of them.
You wouldn't know of any, would you by any chance?
What's he looking for?
Secret rooms?
What exactly are you looking for?
I am in search of one of the Al Azif keys, but please don't tell anyone.
As you know, the grimoire is composed of seven chapters, each one closed with a key, yes?
Well, I'm sure Mortimer must have hidden his in a safe place somewhere.
Yes, probably.
That's news to me. I wasn't aware that Mortimer even HAD a key for the AL Azif.
Not at all, sorry!
Unfortunately, I can't help you there.
I thought as much.
Never mind, I'll just have to shake him up a bit more.
Of course
Yes, I know of two.
Oh! Really?
Louis, God bless you!
There's one behind the large chimney in the portrait gallery.
And the other one's in Mortimer's study.
Tell me about the one in his study! Would you know how to open it?
Yes
Certainly.
Under his desk you'll find a pedal which moves the painting behind.
You'll see, you can't miss it.
Then you just need to enter 1191 as the code and the door will open.
Ah! Louis, I will never forget what you just did for me.
No
No, and it's not by want of trying.
Unfortunately, I have never been able to get inside.
Never mind, you have already helped me enormously, Louis.
I shall go see for myself.
Leave them
I won't keep you any longer.
De Richet! What do you want?
Oh great...  he doesn't look inclined to let me pass...
Get rid of him, Louis.
Don't make me repeat myself, de Richet...
What are you here for?
You wouldn't be in cahoots with Péru by any chance, now would you?
Undermine him
Of course I am. We're both French, so it's obvious we're both involved in all the same shady activities.
No, that's not what I meant...
And you know what they say about the French, right...
Don't make me say what I didn't say!
I was only passing through
Absolutely not, I only ask to pass through.
What 's all this palaver about now?
I'm watching you, de Richet! You've been sneaking all over this place for the past two days!
Only the balcony is behind there! So stop your skulduggery and tell me what you're doing here!
And you?
What am I doing here?
I could ask you the same question. This isn't your room, far as I know.
Don't go trying one-upmanship with me!
I...  I have a... very good reason to be here...
Come to see how Péru is
Absolutely not, I only came here to check on Monsieur Péru.
His catatonic state seems to be beyond traditional medicine.
Listen here, de Richet. Don't take me for a pigeon.
There's nothing odd about Péru. Mortimer has simply sedated him. There's nothing out of the ordinary about that, so find something else to say!
Take revenge on Péru for Elizabeth
And yourself? You wouldn't be here because of what Péru did to Elizabeth, by any chance?
I...  What? But...  what are you going on about, for crying out loud?
I'm convinced you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You had an affair with Elizabeth, you cared about her and you did not appreciate Péru beating on her.
I...  but...  no, no, not at all, why...
... it's got nothing to do with that!
Right, find a way of getting rid of him, Louis, otherwise he won't leave you alone.
I am persuaded that Mortimer has a secret room somewhere in the manor.
If I'm here, it's obviously because Péru must know where it is.
But you might even know about it...  do you?
Yes
As a matter of fact I do, it's in his study.
What?
Yes, under his desk you'll find a pedal which moves the painting on the wall behind.
You can't miss it, it's the Nightmare.
And have you been inside?
Tell him how to enter
Yes.
You type 1191 into the door mechanism and you're done.
No
No, unfortunately not.
No
I haven't the foggiest idea.
As if by chance!
You are hiding something from me. I don't believe you for a single second!
Try in his study, right?
Look, if Mortimer really has a secret room, you ought to try in his study, don't you think?
Probably, yes.
Anyhow, that's where I would have built one.
Calm him down.
Sir, I'm not here to oppose you.
I urge you to calm down.
It's my first time on this island, and as you can well imagine, no one has ever told me where all the secret rooms are.
And look at Péru, he's virtually foaming at the mouth. You'll get nothing out of him now.
Of course! You know nothing at all, do you. How convenient that is!
I've got my eye on you, de Richet!
Good Outcome
I'm sure you are hiding something from me and I'll soon find out what it is!
We haven't finished our business yet, you and I!
I'll go and see in his study.
But I'm warning you, de Richet. If you're taking me for a ride, I'll make you regret it!
Right, that's one thing out of the way.
Bad Outcome
All right, that's enough, de Richet!
You are wasting my time! Get out of here immediately, I've things to do!
Hang on a moment, I...
Out!
Come on, for Christ's sake, Péru! Wake up!
Louis, do you want something?
Only to pass through
Oh, don't bother yourself for me.
I'm just passing through.
Oh please, feel free.
Right, now it's just the two of us...
I am sure you know his little secrets!
You have been a good doggy all these years, so you must know where he hides his little secrets!
What did he do?
Am I disturbing you perhaps?
Why, not at all.
Now we are on the same side, Louis.
How can I help?
What were you doing with Péru?
Tell me, what were you two doing?
I'm trying to get some sense out of this vegetable but I'm afraid Mortimer's over-sedated him.
He can't even speak.
But I'm not beaten yet, I'm sure he will end up telling me everything he knows and especially where Mortimer's hideout is.
The manor must be riddled with secret rooms and I'm sure that Péru knows some of them.
You wouldn't know of any, would you by any chance?
What's he looking for?
Secret rooms?
What exactly are you looking for?
I am in search of one of the Al Azif keys, but please don't tell anyone.
As you know, the grimoire is composed of seven chapters, each one closed with a key, yes?
Well, I'm sure Mortimer must have hidden his in a safe place somewhere.
Yes, probably.
That's news to me. I wasn't aware that Mortimer even HAD a key for the AL Azif.
Not at all, sorry!
Unfortunately, I can't help you there.
I thought as much.
Never mind, I'll just have to shake him up a bit more.
Of course
Yes, I know of two.
Oh! Really?
Louis, God bless you!
There's one behind the large chimney in the portrait gallery.
And the other one's in Mortimer's study.
Tell me about the one in his study! Would you know how to open it?
Yes
Certainly.
Under his desk you'll find a pedal which moves the painting behind.
You'll see, you can't miss it.
Then you just need to enter 1191 as the code and the door will open.
Ah! Louis, I will never forget what you just did for me.
No
No, and it's not by want of trying.
Unfortunately, I have never been able to get inside.
Never mind, you have already helped me enormously, Louis.
I shall go see for myself.
Leave them
I won't keep you any longer.
De Richet! What do you want?
Oh great...  he doesn't look inclined to let me pass...
Get rid of him, Louis.
Don't make me repeat myself, de Richet...
What are you here for?
You wouldn't be in cahoots with Péru by any chance, now would you?
Undermine him
Of course I am. We're both French, so it's obvious we're both involved in all the same shady activities.
No, that's not what I meant...
And you know what they say about the French, right...
Don't make me say what I didn't say!
I was only passing through
Absolutely not, I only ask to pass through.
What 's all this palaver about now?
I'm watching you, de Richet! You've been sneaking all over this place for the past two days!
Only the balcony is behind there! So stop your skulduggery and tell me what you're doing here!
And you?
What am I doing here?
I could ask you the same question. This isn't your room, far as I know.
Don't go trying one-upmanship with me!
I...  I have a... very good reason to be here...
Come to see how Péru is
Absolutely not, I only came here to check on Monsieur Péru.
His catatonic state seems to be beyond traditional medicine.
Listen here, de Richet. Don't take me for a pigeon.
There's nothing odd about Péru. Mortimer has simply sedated him. There's nothing out of the ordinary about that, so find something else to say!
Take revenge on Péru for Elizabeth
And yourself? You wouldn't be here because of what Péru did to Elizabeth, by any chance?
I...  What? But...  what are you going on about, for crying out loud?
I'm convinced you know exactly what I'm talking about.
You had an affair with Elizabeth, you cared about her and you did not appreciate Péru beating on her.
I...  but...  no, no, not at all, why...
... it's got nothing to do with that!
Right, find a way of getting rid of him, Louis, otherwise he won't leave you alone.
I am persuaded that Mortimer has a secret room somewhere in the manor.
If I'm here, it's obviously because Péru must know where it is.
But you might even know about it...  do you?
Yes
As a matter of fact I do, it's in his study.
What?
Yes, under his desk you'll find a pedal which moves the painting on the wall behind.
You can't miss it, it's the Nightmare.
And have you been inside?

Out!
You ought to go, Louis... 
 I have a few things to discuss with this gentleman.
