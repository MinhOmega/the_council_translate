Give chocolate

Lord Mortimer
Well, Waldo, is your master good?
Pretty boy Waldo...  pretty boy...
I don't really know what I was expecting...
Ask him for the code, you never know.
Tell me the door code.
Pretty boy Waldo...  pretty boy...
Here I am, talking to a bird...  shame on me...
Sarah de Richet
Sarah de Richet, Waldo, you know Sarah?
Sarah...  Sarah, don't go...  Stop it...  Stop it, no...

Don't go...  Sarah, no...  No, stop, Sarah...  Stop it.. No...
Good God, what's been happening here?

All right, that's enough of that.
If I go on talking to a myna bird, I'll...  I'll end up going crazy...

Chocolates. It's said they cause nightmares, but I doubt that's what my mother was trying to say.
No hidden mechanisms here. I'll have to look elsewhere.
Let's take a closer look... 
Take a chocolate
Dark chocolate beans. Very bitter.
They're greatly prized in high society.
Examine the chocolates
Judging by the shape, I'd say they're Criollo coco beans. The chocolate of the Mayas, the rarest of the beans.
Some even say they're an aphrodisiac... 
When a product is in fashion, people attribute all sorts of virtues to it... 
Not to be given to animals.
The dessert the most in vogue nowadays!
These chocolates are probably a protocol gift. Everybody in Europe loves them nowadays.
Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, has her own personal chocolate maker at Versailles.
They say it's her guilty little morning ritual, before getting dressed. A cup with one sugar and some vanilla, if I remember rightly.
I wouldn't be surprised if Mortimer has them delivered straight from South America.

Some goat skulls...  Chicken legs...  Now we all know what that's for.
I'm a little surprised at Mortimer.
I didn't see him as the type to be organizing little pagan parties, invoking occult powers, and dancing naked under the full moon.
I'm more used to seeing cheap charms like this sold by charlatans in Pré Saint Gervais.

Hey! A book on Fuseli... 
In 1783,  one of his paintings was a huge success.
Translate the preface
“William,
I hope you'll find a place worthy of the name for my Nightmare.
I look forward to seeing it hanging in your abode.
Your friend, Henry Fuseli “
Read the description
“It represents a woman lying down, with the devil sitting on her. In the background, a horse is looking at the scene through curtains... ”
It's most common title is...  “The Nightmare”
Why, yes... that rings a bell... 
I swear I've seen that painting somewhere around here...  But where?

It's a book on the history of the crusades. I don't think it has any connection with my research.
I don't think this book can help me.
History of the First Crusades by Pierre Amedée de la Sarde.
Strange...  all the dates are all...  wrong; they indicate events that took place in the year 5000 and something.
Wait, did I miss something?
Hey, the dates indicate “AL”, and it looks like 4000 years have been added to our calendar...  oh that counting system again!
First crusade (5096-5099)
The famous call of Pope Urban II.
Twenty years after the capture of Jerusalem from the Arabs by the Turks, Urban II convened the council.
He promises a Plenary Indulgence to Christians who go and get Jerusalem back from the Turks.
The result: the Jewish community on the road to Jerusalem found itself persecuted for no reason. Twelve thousand Jews would perish.
Not to mention the massacre of Ma'arra, where acts of cannibalism by Frankish crusaders were reported.
Or even the capture of Jerusalem, where approximately 30,000 were left dead.
It signaled the beginning of centuries of wars of religion.
Second crusade (5147-5149)
Or how Louis VII, King of France, eager to be pardoned for the death of thousands of innocent people in the fire of the church of Vitry...
... convinces the pope to authorize him to lead his own crusade...
The result: in Germany, a new outburst of violence against the Jewish community.
And a monumental fiasco by poor Louis VII, cuckolded by his wife's uncle.
Third crusade (5189-5192)
The famous call from Pope Gregory VIII in his Audita Tremendi bull of 5187... ?
Oh, the crusade where Richard the Lionheart had distinguished himself.
It states that the first sea blockade of Saint Jean d'Acre was broken in the 12th month of 5190 AL, whereas the siege had been going on for two years.
Link the author to the dates
The author is Pierre Amédée de la Sarde...
None other than the grand master of the Masonic Lodge of Paris.
Now I understand why the dates are offset.
He's using dates based on Anno Lucis, year zero of the masonic calendar, by adding 4000 years to the Gregorian calendar.
But, I thought that that calendar starts in March...
Analyze the dates
The crusades took place not long after the year one thousand.
Here all the dates say 5000 and something...  I'm guessing this dating system begins 4000 years before the calendar that we use.
Yet I'm getting the feeling that there's something else, another small detail but...  but what is it?

Examine the lever.
Looks like the same as the one on the other side.
Think about the lock.
It looks too easy...  It could be a trap.
Think about the mechanism as a whole.
The mechanism passes through the wall, the wheels are the same on both sides.
Chances are, the combination I used on the other side works on this side too.
Think about the shape of the cylinders.
These cylinders rotate on the same central axis. So when I enter a number on one side, it corresponds to another one on the other side.

Emily, I must speak to you...
What's the matter, Louis?
About...  last night, I'm guessing?
I...  sadly, no, even if I'd have liked to, I...
Alas, there are more pressing matters...
I have news about your sister.
What have you found out?
Look. I've started piecing together the events leading up to my mother's disappearance...  and your sister's.
Did...  did my mother know about your secret?
Yes, even though I belong to the English chapter, her rank in the Order gives her access to a good deal of personal information.
It must have been Emma I saw in my vision...
I was given to understand that my mother and your sister bonded during their stay.
Speak about the messages.
They kept up a secret correspondence, which makes me think they were suspicious of someone.
And did you find out who it was?
No, but Von Wöllner is mentioned.
They were planning to make a quick getaway and were looking to hide something beforehand.
Have you got these messages?
Show her
Yes, go ahead, take a look.
I see.
I must say...  thanks for your honesty, Louis.
Say no
Oh, no, sorry. Someone was coming so I had to burn them so as not to been seen with them.
You burned them...  Very well.
Ask her to “Go beyond the nightmare”
I've got a question that might seem a little bit strange...
I'm listening.
If I said “Go beyond the nightmare”, would that ring any bells?
Mmmm... No, means nothing to me...
Do you mean literally or figuratively speaking?
Literally, why not a place.
It might be a place. I don't know where but it's a lead.
You ought to ask his Eminence; he knows the house and its estate very well, being a frequent visitor here.
Thanks for the advice.
Figuratively, no doubt a metaphor
My mother used to talk about it. In the figurative sense, probably.
We still need to understand what she was referring to, though.
If I find something, I'll let you know.
Don't send her on my mother's trail.
If Mother's really killed her sister, I'd better find her by myself.
They say they spent a lot of time together.
They got along well.
Oh, really?
Do you think your mother liked Duchess Hillsborrow?
Of course, she did. After all, she's your sister.
Well, We'll find them, Emily. Trust me.
Let's go, Louis, they're waiting for us.
Should I speak to her about my vision? If what I saw is true, she might want to take revenge...
Tell her
Emily...  There's something else...
Go on then.
It's...  It's about your sister.
I don't know what happened exactly, but it's possible that my mother had a go at her.
I know, Louis. I found out that same evening.
Well, thanks for not trying to hide it.
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know if I could trust you.
Now I know I can.
It seems that your mother tricked Emma. She apparently asked her to hide an important book, so that even she wouldn't know where it was.
And then she shot her like a dog to make sure no one would ever find it again.
Does she know why?
Why would she do that?
I don't know Louis.
But I'll find out, you can count on that!
Who spoke to her about it?
How did you find out?
Sir Gregory told me on my arrival.
Keep quiet
I'd better keep that to myself for the time being...
I'm sincerely sorry, Emily.
Thank you, Louis.
You're very kind, it means a lot to me.
But you do realize your mother will have to accept the consequences of her acts.
But, there must be an explanation, Emily...
That's what we shall see.
We'll speak about it later somewhere...  safe.
Come Louis, they're waiting for us.
Emily, I must speak to you...

The wheels are stuck! Shit! I'm cornered like a rat!
Someone's coming... 
Please, don't let it be Mortimer!
Of course! How could I even imagine he would be here!
Who is it?
Deliberately avoiding me! Four years ago I was his favorite but nowadays I have to ask for an audience with his lordship... 
Dammit! It's Péru... 
Keep quiet
I don't know if I should but... 
Well, that's it! I've had enough of being humiliated!!
I'm wasting my time here...

Monsieur Péru!
It's Monsieur de Richet. I'm sort of trapped behind this painting.
Help me out of here, please!
What are you playing at, goddammit!
How can I open it?
After everything I've done on his behalf, he dares treat me like a lackey!
Keep quiet
I've bled the Parisian elite for the sake of his whims and what have I got to show for it?
Doesn't even have the courtesy to give me five minutes of his time!
I wanted to put my mind at ease...  Well that's done. I know what I've got to to do now.
I must find my mother!  So much for discretion..
Monsieur Péru?
It's me, Monsieur de Richet. I need your help...

You do surprise me.
It's not what you're thinking.
I'll explain everything..
No, you will not, Sir!
It has nothing to do with me, and by the way, I never even saw you.
So, I'll be on my way now.
Thanks again.
Why such indulgence?
You had me trapped...  Why not say anything?
I would have wanted someone to open the door for me, too.
And while it's too late for me, it may not be for you...

Yeah...  Goodbye.
Examine the material
Looks like obsidian, or onyx. It must weigh a ton... 
Examine the inscriptions
Strange...  I don't recognize the alphabet. I wonder where the pictograms are from?
It isn't Egyptian or Hebrew.
There are two inscriptions on the sides as well as on the top.
No way to know what's underneath.
Absolutely no idea what it's for, but I find this cube fascinating.

Examine the equipment
What kind of experiments does Mortimer carry out here?
It's a dissection table...  So Mortimer does autopsies...  here on his desert island?
But who is he doing autopsies on then?
Look at the instruments
The little surgeon's perfect collection...

This is my mother's writing! I've picked up her trail!
What is she up to?
Obviously she wants to lure Mortimer somewhere but...  but where?
The only clue she's left for Mortimer is this stone sword. It must be intentional.
Looks like a decorative sword like...  from a statue, for example.
And judging by the state of it, I'm...  I'm guessing it's been left outside for a long time.
I have absolutely got to find out where it came from!

The book of the Mortimer family.
Hmm, nope...  no mechanism here.
Presentation of the Mortimer family.
Well, well...  history of the Mortimer lineage.
Looks like his ancestors have always sought to improve society, and have had an open attitude towards the arts...
Family tree
Oh, the family tree!
William Alexander Mortimer, first of his name.
The first William Alexander Mortimer.
He was born in 1131 and distinguished himself during the Third Crusade during which he rubbed shoulders with Richard the Lionheart.
He showed outstanding bravery during the siege of Saint Jean d'Acre.
He died in 1211, in the county of Westford at the age of 80. What longevity! Nice!
Nothing is mentioned about his wife.
William Terrence Mortimer
The direct descendant of William Alexander Mortimer I was born in 1195, on his father's return from the Crusade.
Only son. More discreet than his father, it states that he was widely traveled.
He produced only one descendant, named William Michael Mortimer.
He died in 1275. There's no chapter dedicated to his mother.
Look for the last descendant.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer.
Lover of the Arts and the Sciences, he took up politics at an early age.
After rapidly becoming influential, he decides to retire from public life...
... in order to organize conferences reserved for the elite with the aim of finding answers to world problems.
Blah, blah, blah...
He's also an only son and the book doesn't mention any known descendant.
See other ancestors
Alright...  for one, the women of the lineage are not mentioned at all. What a cavalier attitude!
Right, let's see...  Who else is there?
William Berth Mortimer
Only son. A descendant with a singular name. He also took a wife, and had only one child. Named William, again.
William August Mortimer
Another at random. William Mortimer, again! Only son, him too. Born in 1573 and died in 1665: the Mortimers live to a ripe old age, that's for sure!
Discreet, again. The summary states that he was an excellent merchant...  and that, towards the end of his life, he entered politics.
Analyze the familial organization
All the descendants are called William (... ) Mortimer. There have been only male descendants. All of them only sons.
Strange...  it was uncommon to have only one child in those days, let alone all only sons!
How is that possible? It really makes you wonder if all those sons really are official descendants...
I'm smelling something shady here...

Analyze the names
Let's see. All Mortimer's ancestors are called “William (something) Mortimer”.
That happens a lot in noble families, but here it's systematic. Not a SINGLE generation ever breaks the custom.
Looks like this family is very attached to their principles.

Patronage of the Mortimer family.
This seems to be the list of grants and sponsorships given by the Mortimer family.
Don Luis de la Cerda
“In 1489, the Mortimer family participates in the purchase of the caravel Santa Clara from Juan Niño, shipowner from Moguer...
“... on behalf of Don Luis de la Cerda. The vessel will be renamed La Niña... ”
La Nina?
La Niña, yes! That's one of the three caravels of the expedition of Christopher Columbus! They enabled him to discover the Americas.
Well, you can certainly say the grandfather had a flair for business...
Don't take note.
Longqing
“In 1567, the Mortimer family financed a brickworks in Qin-huang-dao, in China, fitted out with 51 furnaces 3.5 meters high...
... in guise of a protocol gift for Long-qing, the emperor of the Ming dynasty.”
Longqing, in 1567?
I'll bet that brickworks helped maintain the Great Wall.

Nairac family
“In 1645, the Mortimer family allocated a pension, to be passed down the generations, to the Nairac family from Bordeaux, shipowners and refiners from father to son.”
A family known for their expeditions to Africa and America...
France, Africa, the Americas...
The Golden Triangle. That means they got rich on the backs of African slaves...

Albert the Great
“From 1235 to 1280, the Mortimer family granted an annual pension to Albert the Great, archbishop of Regensburg...
... in order to fund his research and the writing of De Mirabilibus Mundi, books about the wonders of the world.”
De Mirabilibus Mundi...
Let's not forget it recorded the recipe for gunpowder in the form of an anagram...
They democratized firearms in Europe, no less...

Others
Ponce de León
“In 1513, the Mortimers finance the expedition of Ponce de Leon to the New World.”
That was the expedition that resulted in the discovery of Florida, in fact!
Achille Basmarein
“In 1772, Lord Mortimer made a donation of 112 000 pounds to the attention of Achille Basmarein...
... major shipowner of Bordeaux, for the construction of a ship, the Clary.”
The Clary?
But...  that's Lafayette's ship!!! I thought he paid with his own coin!
It's even been suggested that grants were given by the Order... but in fact, that wasn't true at all!

Academy Mersenne
“In 1635, the Mortimer family sponsored the Academy Mersenne for 30 years in Paris for works in the sciences and in philosophy”
That was generous...
But not entirely selfless when you think about Blaise Pascal who developed the first calculating machine at the same time!
Denis Papin
“From 1685 to 1720, the Mortimer family allocated an annual pension to Denis Papin for his brilliant works in pneumatics and hydraulics.”
That reminds me of spectacular experiments such as his first submarine, which didn't end all that well, if I remember correctly.
Denis Papin?...
In my opinion, his lesser known invention of the steam piston ought to be more important in the future...
That's strange, I thought he died in 1712...

Ivan IV Vassiliévitch
“In 1550, the Mortimer family financed half of the construction of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow...
... by way of a protocol gift for Ivan IV Vassiliévitch”.

Ivan IV?...

I met Manuel Godoy

I could have shown interest in Mortimer's bird
I got locked inside Mortimer's secret study
I got out of Mortimer's secret study without any trouble
I found a way of getting into the secret study
I searched Mortimer's secret study thoroughly
I found "The Nightmare" that my mother mentioned
I got some information out of von Wollner
I did not get any information out of Von Wollner

I poisoned Waldo, the bird in Mortimer's office
Well, better not dwell on it then.
Well, better not dwell on it then.
Dear Lord Mortimer,
As agreed, I have changed your old lock for one of my invention.
Drawing inspiration from your doctor friend, Mister Guillotin, here is the model of your new lock, if you appreciate my prototype.
It is difficult to imagine how it all fits together, but it will be located in the middle of the present door.
The aim being to alter nothing of the door's functionality, but to add a bit of spice.
Depending on the line-up of the wheels, the aforementioned lock will open, or will punish the snooper whose faith is not strong enough.
I called my invention: The Judgment of faith, because if a snooper is unable to resist opening it, they will be punished...
I hope you'll appreciate the irony of the situation.

This is unexpected activity in this sector. It looks like there are also many unknowns, even for Mortimer.

Moreover, it shows a fair number of sea voyages being organized toward the American continent...  no doubt with slaves.
How many men are broken in this "trade"? Tens of thousands each year, according to what people say...

You will pay dearly, Péru!
I'm sure you were involved somewhere along the line!
That's right, pretend you don't know.
One piece of advice, don't travel through France on your way back or it will cost you dearly.
Come now, my friends. Let's calm down.
Everyone seems to be a little unnecessarily heated. Don't forget where you are, please.
What's going on here exactly?
Sir Gregory called us together to introduce the last guest... 
... but hardly had we arrived when he set upon Monsieur Péru.
Who is it?
And who is this charming character?
Manuel Godoy, the Duke of la Alcudia.
He's the head of the Spanish government, Monsieur de Richet.
He's the one who, in practice, controls Spain.
Dammit, it's him whom my mother spoke about in the letter on the wharf.
Why?
And what has Monsieur Péru done to once again provoke someone's anger?
We don't really know just yet.
I get the feeling it won't be long before it gets out... 
How could you dare do such a thing? You're all out of your minds!
Really, Duke Manuel, what's made you kick up such a fuss?
What, have you not heard?
Well, let me inform you that yesterday morning, at 10:22 am precisely, in the middle of the Place de la Révolution in Paris,
by decree of the National Convention which Monsieur Péru works for, King Louis was guillotined.
What?!!
The King of France is dead, gentlemen!
Our monarchies are in danger! I have said it before!
How dare they?
Friends, friends...  let us calm down... 
Don't pretend to be surprised. He got a fair trial!
Ridiculous! Bastard!
He was sentenced to death by 361 votes to 360.
You beheaded a King for ONE vote...  Is that your democracy?
What an obnoxious act.
Until this, anything was possible. This political coup will have grave consequences!
France is lost... 
Gentlemen, please, let us take a step back a moment.
In the name of holiness, he was the highest representative of God in France, Emily!
Put oil on the flame
Well, King Louis was imprisoned for several months, as far as I know.
What have your governments been doing to change France's resolution?
I beg your pardon?
I've heard you cackling like outraged old hens for a while now, but you had every opportunity to take a stance beforehand, if I'm not mistaken.
That is a characteristic of Noblemen, Louis. You'll soon get used to it here.
Gentlemen, that is enough.
Calm things down.
Gentlemen, Duchess, we are among people of reputable company here.
We should be able to manage the conflicts of our nations in a respectful and orderly manner.
I fully agree with you, sir.
But... 
That's enough, sir.
Think of the consequences for the Order.
If I remember rightly what Mother told me one night, King Louis was secretly also part of the Order.
I wonder what impact his death will have on us.
Sad news, sir.
Say nothing
... 
With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Louis Mauras de Richet.
Are you related to Sarah de Richet?
Sarah is his mother, Duke.
Gentlemen, this news affects us all but I must ask you to remain calm.
It's not the first time History has taken us by surprise.
Let's ensure that our respective countries are allowed to respond appropriately to this news.
Oh, rest assured, the response will not fall short, my friend.
Good for you.
Well, your Grace, here I was preparing to introduce you as is proper, and you've beaten me to it.
I'm delighted that we are all together at last. Our meeting will therefore be able to kick off shortly.
I have just a few more little preparations to take care of before you all find out the reason for your presence here.
In the meantime, I shall leave you to get to know one another.
When you hear the bell, please proceed to the conclave room on my left, behind that door.
I'll see you later.
You will pay dearly, Péru!
I'm sure you were involved somewhere along the line!

Dear Mr Guido Poletti,
I'm writing with regard to the dates of the paintings that I sent you for your temporary exhibition.
Please note that they are part of my private collection and are dated according to the Freemason's calendar (AL) in use at the time.
As you may well have guessed, you must remember to subtract four thousand years if you don't want the public to be surprised at the dating of the works.
No need to remind you that the Freemason year (AL) begins in March, not january.
About the Longinus painting, I took the liberty to have the spear touched up so it better corresponds to the actual spear.
I cannot urge you strongly enough to do the same for yours.
Yours sincerely.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer, Marquis of Westfordshire.

Please note that they are part of my private collection and are dated according to the Freemason's calendar (AL) in use at the time.
As you may well have guessed, you must remember to subtract four thousand years if you don't want the public to be surprised at the dating of the works.
No need to remind you that the Freemason year (AL) begins in March, not january.
About the Longinus painting, I took the liberty to have the spear touched up so it better corresponds to the actual spear.
I cannot urge you strongly enough to do the same for yours.
Yours sincerely.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer, Marquis of Westfordshire.
This painting isn't finished... 
And looks like Mortimer probably did it... 
Not bad but you can't exactly say it's been done in the style of the period.

"The Nightmare" painted by Fuseli in 1781.
Ah...  This must be what my mother was talking about!
Now, just need to find out what she meant by "go beyond".
Hey...  looks like it's mounted on rails on each side. It should lift up, I think.
There must be a mechanism somewhere...

Open sesame.
Open sesame.
Now, now what have we got here?
Looks like a model...  A model of a lock. It's as if Mortimer is fond of complicating things sometimes.
Well, I hope I never have to try and unlock it.

Looks like a war painting, it's dated.
Ok, no mechanism behind this painting. I'll have to keep looking
Hey...  there are two dates on this painting!
1154 A.D. and 5154 A.L.
Analyze the dates
The two dates most likely relate to two calendars: the Gregorian calendar and the Freemason calendar.

A painting about a siege, dated.
No mechanism here.
A painting depicting the third crusade. It's titled “The Winter before the Fall of Saint Jean d'Acre”
Analyze the scene.
From what I know, the fall of Saint Jean d'Acre took place in the summer of 1191.
Now according to this title, it's wintertime on the painting, so it can't have been late in the year of 1191.
It must be in the first months of that year. Probably in January or February of that year.
Situate the scene.
The siege of Saint Jean d'Acre...  It was a major conflict during the third crusade.
Richard the Lionheart and Philip Augustus fought to take the town back.
It was the crusaders'  first operation to take back the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
Link to readings
I get the impression I've seen that before.
In fact, I've read something on the Crusades before in this study.
He clearly loves the subject.

A family ancestor apparently.
No, no mechanism here.
William Alexander Mortimer 1st, the 12th month of Anno Lucis 5190.
That's a funny date... 
Analyze
The date's calculated in Anno Lucis. The twelfth month is...  February?
So that makes...  that makes it February...  1191.
That funny date again... 
That date in 5000 and something again... 
I wonder what in the world it means...

No, let's look elsewhere.

"Weakness of the Human Psyche" by Guilhem Trimmoer.
Mh, he says: "It is possible to drill an idea into someone by constant daily repetition, until the mind gives in".
And goes on: "There are hundreds of good ways to live life, but you only need one to convince the masses that it's the only one possible".
The author isn't letting any ethical principals get in his way, is he ?

You are expected in the small salon, Sir.
A skeleton...  by the name of Gustave, if the plaque on the plinth is anything to go by.
Mortimer has given a name to his anatomy skeleton...  that's morbid.
Ah, his right hand is missing.

What do you want, Louis?
Ask her about the nightmare.
I have a question that might seem a bit strange, but...
Go on.
If I said "Go beyond the nightmare", would that mean anything to you?
Mmmm...  No, means nothing to me...
Do you mean literally or figuratively speaking?
Literally, why not a place.
It can be a place. I don't know where but it...  it's a lead I think.
You ought to ask his Eminence; he knows the house and its estate very well, being a frequent visitor.
I believe he's in the Grand Salon...
Thank you for your advice.
In the figurative sense, no doubt a metaphor
In the figurative sense, probably.
I'm trying to understand what it refers to.
Well, if I come up with anything, I'll let you know.
Speak about the nightmare again.
I've already asked you but I don't remember the answer.
What did you say to me about "going beyond the nightmare"?
Good heavens, you're losing your memory!
I haven't the least idea what it might mean.
Oh, alright. That's too bad.
Ask her opinion about Godoy.
What do you think of our last guest?
Well, I never thought I would get the chance to meet that Hispanic Casanova in the flesh.
His reputation is well known. The gentleman collects lovers, including would you believe it, the Queen of Spain...  !
Mention the rumor
The Queen of Spain likes to indiscreetly say: "the King, Godoy and myself make up the Holy Trinity"!
The people have appropriatly renamed them "the goat, the ruffian and the whore"!
(laughing) I didn't see you being a mudslinger in your idle hours, I must say!
I'm not interested.
I doubt that Lord Mortimer invited him for his charm, if you want my opinion.
Leave her.
You're leaving me?
Unfortunately, I have things to do. Thank you again, Madam.
Tell me more about the coming conference.
Emily, what can you tell me about the coming conference?
Sir Gregory and Lord Mortimer organize this kind of high society meeting every so often in order to consider the world situation.
But to what purpose?
Well, by bringing together the most influential people from the dominant nations of the modern world, they allow the mighty to discuss matters with calm clarity.
There are precedents of armistices being signed at the end of these talks, you know...
Talking while holding a glass of brandy makes things easier, you'll see.
Monsieur Bonaparte, may I speak with you a moment?
Mais oui.
Tell me more about the coming conference.
Would you have any more information about the conference Lord Mortimer spoke of?
Nothing at all.
Mortimer is very committed to secrecy when it comes to his conferences.
But given the presence of Monsieur Péru and ourselves, I think it must concern France to some extent, otherwise I doubt he would have invited three Frenchmen to his table.
Ask him about “the nightmare”.
Does the expression "go beyond the nightmare" mean anything to you at all?
Well, metaphorically, yes, it sums up the career of a soldier quite well.
I doubt that is what you want to hear, though.
Indeed.
That's surely not what I'm looking for... 
Well, monsieur, if you are looking for a phrase book, Lord Mortimer must surely have one, giving the number of books he has.
You ought to check in the library of the Tower, you never know.
Ask him his opinion of Godoy.
What do you think of Duke Godoy?
Well, I'd rather not express any opinion of him.
Why is that?
His reputation is enough for me!
His reputation precedes him.
There are some rumors about his loose morals... 
Juste, monsieur. Add to that his devouring ambition, if you want my opinion... 
Playing at lover-boy rather than gaining merit for his career, it's a disgrace for any soldier!
Tell me more... 
Meaning?
This gentleman enjoys people talking about him for too many reasons... 
His undeserved titles...  More than ten in just four years! And each one more prestigious than the one before.
You don't think he deserves them?
If I had seen him on the battlefield, there might be some doubt... 
But that is not the case.
The Queen would rather not risk losing him, so she consoles him with awards and titles!
So you don't have a very positive opinion... 
His coveting French Catalonia does not encourage me to have one... 
He doesn't give a damn about his reputation.
I'm sure that a soldier such as yourself is not interested in vulgar rumors.
Quite right.
If only this cursed gossip didn't come to stain the uniform he has the audacity to wear.
Don't you find him worthy?
But how could he be, monsieur? He never sets foot on the battlefield, too occupied with charming the Queen!
Have you any idea of the number of titles that coward has won in just a few years?
No, not really.
Ten! And that Don Juan spends the best part of his time under the Queen's skirts.
The bugger must have some hidden talent given all of the gifts she gives him!
Will this not be an opportunity to get to know him better?
You'll be able to check if the hearsay is true over these next few days... 
I sincerely doubt that... 
The context does not allow me to give him my trust!
I understand your point of view.
Leave Napoleon
Well, I'll be leaving you now.
Shall we meet up again later?
Wait, monsieur.
Any news of your mother?
Unfortunately not, no.
I hope to speak with her about my deal before I leave.
Let me know if you find her.
A plus tard, monsieur.

Ah, Louis, just the man.
Good Lord, how did the King come to be executed?
I would think that the Order would have intervened!
The King was playing with fire.
Your Eminence, I haven't been following the case. I'm sure that the Order did everything in its power.
Unfortunately, you know the situation in Paris and...
Well, it's chaotic at best. Anything can happen in those revolutionary tribunals.
The king is the official representative of God on earth, my son!
Your Eminence, France has become a secular state.
The King was just another citizen to them. He refused to admit his errors, looked down upon them and attempted to escape.
What did he expect?
France has lost all reason, Louis...
The King made things worse all by himself.
Your Eminence, I'm sorry for King Louis but he did everything to put himself there.
Louis! How can you say such a thing?
Even if France rejects the Church, you don't go and behead a person of high status! They always serve our cause better alive than dead.
Politically, it's absurd!
Don't insist
I invite you to speak about it with my mother as soon as she reappears.
Is there Any news of her?
I...  Well, I hope it won't be long before I find her, your Eminence.
Louis, I'm counting on you!
If you don't find Sarah before my departure, I must ask you to give me back the letter I gave you.
Well, don't worry about that, your Eminence.
Now, you wanted to speak to me?
Do you know the theme of the conference?
I'm sure a man like you is in the circle of trust. Would you know what the conference that Lord Mortimer mentioned is going to be about?
Not really, my son.
Well, be it Lord Mortimer or Sir Gregory, we are never informed about the theme of the conference before it begins.
Ask him about “the nightmare”.
If I say "the nightmare" to you, does it make you think of anything?
Your question is strange, my son...
Difficult to say. Could you at least tell me a little more about the context?
A place or an object?
Well, I mean, if it were a place or an object found on this island, what would you think of first?
Mmm, the nightmare...  Mmmmm...
No, I don't see anything...  I'm sorry.
Well, that's too bad.
Ah...  wait...  I suppose it might be that horrible painting hanging in Lord Mortimer's study.
Make him believe you're not that interested.
Right...  Well, don't worry about it, I was...  I was just curious.
A connection with anything here
Think of a place and tell me the first thing that comes into your mind when I say "the nightmare".
Mmm, let me think.
I'd say...
Lord Mortimer's favorite painting, on the wall behind his desk.
You know, that painting caused quite a stir when it was exhibited.
It is titled the nightmare and it shows a woman lying down with a creature sitting on her, and in the background, a horse.
I don't know if it will be of any help, but I can't think of anything else.
You never know...  Thank you for that though, your Eminence.
I ought to go and see it, just in case, though.
Ask him his opinion of Godoy.
I was wondering what to think of that Manuel Godoy.
He is reputed to be a very ambitious character...  at every level.
But his faith is unwavering. He is a staunch defender of the Church. You can believe me.
I know of his reputation.
It's true there's much said about him...
For better and for worse but that is a prerogative of power, it would seem.
His close ties with the Queen unfortunately sully her government.
Fortunately, we are not men to take heed of such gossip.
Are we?
Of course not, your Eminence.
What a disgrace nonetheless for the King.
I can only imagine...
If I were to officiate at the Court of Spain, believe me, I would speak out!
She is of Bourbon lineage, by God's grace, she has a duty toward her blood!
What can we expect, your Eminence, everything gets lost over the years.
Tell me about these rumors?
As to his faith, I have no doubt.
However, his ambition seems to surpass his morality.
And I hope that it will not sully the crown.
You can say that again...
The blue eyes of the latest infanta, Maria Isabel, have left everyone wondering...
Rumors always accompany men of power, your Eminence...
Naturally, but the number of awards and titles granted by the Queen during these past four years leaves little doubt!
So, Godoy really is this out-and-out rascal who uses his charms on the Queen.
Don't take note
Leave him
Thank you for everything, your Eminence.
I shan't take up anymore of your time.
You are welcome, my son.
I will be seeing you, Louis.
Ah, Louis, just the man.

Speak about the “nightmare”.
“Go beyond the nightmare”... 
Does this line remind you of anything in particular?
You've caught me unaware here, Louis.
Let me think about it a second..
No, nothing comes to mind.
Sorry, Louis, but I am unable to help you.
Ask him his opinion of Godoy.
Monsieur President, what do you think about your counterpart, Duke Manuel?
I'm very surprised he was able to accept Lord Mortimer's invitation, given the political situation in Spain.
Speak about the rumors.
Sadly, people are more preoccupied with his ties to the Queen than they are with his talents as a statesman.
And it is indeed regrettable because he is nonetheless still an important leader.
I am not a man who pays attention to gossip, you know... 
What context?
What do you mean?
The situation is ready to explode with France over Catalonia.
Well, the Duke must have a darn good reason to be absent and come here, mustn't he?
When Lord Mortimer invites you, Louis, you come.
It's always in your best interest.
I wouldn't say that personally, but... 
He must have a good reason.
I wonder what promise Lord Mortimer could have made, to make him agree to come here, given the circumstances.
Who knows... 
Tell me more about the coming conference.
Monsieur President, can you tell me a little more about the coming conference?
Of course, Louis.
That's why we're here.
Lord Mortimer or Sir Gregory regularly organize meetings like this to put forward major projects.
What do you mean by "major projects"?
I'd prefer to let Lord Mortimer explain that to you, Louis.
Let's say he brings together influential people in order to consider possible actions to undertake to guarantee the future of nations.
Do you know the theme of the conference?
Not in the slightest. None of the guests know the theme before arriving.
But you'll see, everything will turn out fine. Don't worry.
Take your leave.
Well, thank you for your time.
Don't mention it, my young friend.
Regarding your question on the nightmare, don't hesitate to question the others about it.
Maybe one of them knows more than I do.
That's a good idea.
I saw the duchess move towards the upper floors and his Eminence head towards the dining room.
As for Monsieur Bonaparte, he remained in the small salon, if I'm not mistaken.
Thank you, once again.
I'll see you in a little bit.

Look, a pack of tarot cards.
Has he been reading the cards?
Mortimer? That would surprise me.
Read the draw.
It is a typical "draw in a line" that answers a specific question... 
To the left, Temperance, that announces a reward for one who patiently waits before taking any action... 
And in the middle, the Chariot which symbolizes triumph and business success... 
To the right, the Emperor evokes a future full of power and stability...

To the left, Temperance, that announces a reward for one who patiently waits before taking any action... 
And in the middle, the Chariot which symbolizes triumph and business success... 
To the right, the Emperor evokes a future full of power and stability... 
Leave
Could you spare a moment, please, sir?
I'm glad you ask, I want to talk to you too.
Of course.
I heard about your mother's disappearance.
He looks concerned...  I don't know why but I doubt it's from sympathy alone.
Let's see what he wants from me.
Any news of her? Have you found her maybe?
What is he waiting for?
Why? Is...  is there something you particularly wanted from her?
I...  no, not specially.
My question's made him feel uneasy but he's keeping his emotions under control.
Your mother and I used to often speak together; I have rarely met someone so learned.
To tell you the truth, I was about to make a deal with her.
Does he have feelings for her?
To hear you speak, it sounds like you and my mother were close.
Let's say I hold your mother in high esteem, yes.
We were even planning to work together.
That's what he was getting at.
I have no time for that.
Well, sir, I must admit I'm a little pushed for time here, so...
Very well.
Tell him what you've found out.
We found traces of her that would indicate she's still on the island.
Her personal belongings?
Yes, but nothing of great interest. Scraps of food, some clothes...
Ah, I see.
Well, too bad.
Does he know her?
To hear you speak, you seem to know my mother well.
Not really.
We met for the first time on this very spot, some weeks back. We had a very pleasant discussion.
She's an exceptionally learned lady with a good head for business, no need for me to tell you that.
I agree...
Did she tell you about our arrangement?
No
No, not at all.
Ah...  I thought she might have spoken to you about it.
Well, too bad.
Pretend to know.
Of course she did.
Perfect, I'm glad to know it.
So, how should we proceed, then?
I...  what do you mean?
Oh come, sir, no point pretending, you know.
You obviously have no idea of what I'm talking about, do you?
So this is why he's so interested.
The cat's out of the bag, now!
More or less but please do...  do refresh my memory.
Yes, of course...  Nothing of great importance in itself...
During one of our discussions, she spoke of an old book which might have been of interest to me and she had agreed to let me have it.
A book about what?
Ancient occultism...  As you are aware, I am a Doctor of Theology.
Prompt him to talk about it
Absolutely, but I was hoping that you could tell me more about it.
Well, she was planning to sell me a very old book.
I will make no secret of the fact that I am passionate about the subject and when Sarah spoke to me about it, her account literally had me enthralled.
Hahahaha, I can think of nothing else since.
How could I know?
How could I know about that, we haven't seen each other for several weeks.
Indeed...  I was simply hoping to pursue the transaction that we had agreed on with you.
Too bad.
You might have come across some old books in her belongings perhaps?
No
No, I don't think so...
Ah, right, I thought she had it with her.
I haven't found anything yet, no.
Too bad.
String him along
Indeed, my mother is never without her favorite book.
Oh! A stroke of luck!
I...  I didn't think her original edition of Bougainville would be...  so captivating to you.
I...  No, indeed...  The one I'm interested in is a very old book, with each chapter under lock and key.
It has nothing to do with de Bougainville's book.
Oh, right. I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that.
Ah! Well, too bad.
He looks obsessed.
The least one can say is that he doesn't beat around the bush...
Sarah never travels without a few books...  What does the one you're looking for look like exactly?
It resembles a grimoire.
It's divided into seven parts, each one individually locked.
It was made in such a way that if someone tried to tamper with it, the sheets would be permanently tarnished. It's a unique copy. There's only one.
The mere mention of it makes his face light up.
I'll take a closer look but I can't promise you anything...
Speak to him about the Mysterium Cosmographicum.
I've found one...
Quite old? With locks on every chapter?
Oh, no...  I'm sorry, sir...  This one is the Mysterium Cosmographicum, a book she is particularly fond of.
Ah...  no, that's not the one...
Poor man's disgusted...  I shouldn't play with his nerves...
I'll look again.
Make him talk about what he's looking for.
As my mother's got so many old books, I'm afraid I won't be able to...
Oh, it's easy, you...  you can't mistake this one.
It's an ancient grimoire, composed of seven parts, each one is closed under lock and key.
It was made in such a way that if someone tried to tamper with it, the sheets would be permanently tarnished. If you find it, you mustn't tamper with it, you see?
That's...  that's unusual...
Unfortunately, that doesn't ring a bell.
I'll look again but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
You seem very upset...
Is it so important to you, this... book?
Well, it's...  It's the search of a lifetime, what can I say?
Every time I move closer to it, it seems to slip away at the last minute.
I was very surprised to learn that your mother had it in her possession.
I thought it was with a certain Von Borchert, in Paris.
Do you know him?
Lie to him
The name doesn't mean anything to me, I'm...  I'm sorry to say.
He's an expert in occult objects and books and your mother said she knew him.
Are you sure his name doesn't ring a bell?
Let me think...
Yes.
Indeed, my mother and I had a brush with this individual just a few months ago.
What about?
About an object stolen from the Order a few years ago which my mother wanted to recover.
Ah...  ah! This situation comes as a great surprise to me...
Huh, I got him now!
Of course, why?
Indeed...  one of your close friends?
No, not really but we were close once, precisely over the case that concerns us now, because he claimed to have the book I'm looking for.
Another dishonest person, what can you say?
Can't trust anyone these days, huh.
No, no, you can't.
Absolutely not.
I've never heard of him.
I'm sorry, I haven't been much help to you.
Well, too bad.
Good Outcome
I hope I've been able to satisfy your curiosity, Mr Von Wöllner, and that you succeed in finding what you're looking for.
Oh! And so do I.
And now, what if you told me who you really are working for, instead of keeping up this pretense?
I beg your pardon?
We both know what you're looking for, Von Wöllner.
You're the one who Von Borchert was planning to sell it to.
For centuries, all those who have come into contact with the Al Azif have bitterly regretted it, Monsieur de Richet!
You are playing a dangerous game!
Please know that I am working for someone who does not appreciate anyone poking around in his business.
Let me guess?
Mortimer
Lord Mortimer.
Oh! You are way off the mark.
There's nothing more for us to say.
Goodbye.
Holm
It's sir Gregory!
Correct. You ought to know then he is not a man who likes to be duped.
You are walking on thin ice, sir.
The King of Prussia.
Your dear king, I should think.
What? You mean Frederic William?
Haha, my poor fellow, you are miles away. That stupid, pretentious puppet wields no real power.
But seeing as you do not wish to be serious, so be it. Good luck to you.
Bad Outcome
I shan't keep you, Monsieur de Richet.
Alright then, thank you.
I hope that your search will prove successful and bring Sarah back to us soon.
I must go now, I'll see you later.
Could you spare a moment, please, sir?
I'm glad you ask, I want to talk to you too.
