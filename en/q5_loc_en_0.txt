Right. It's time we spoke about your mother, Louis.
She isn't missing.
She isn't missing, you know.
What...  what do you mean?
My mother has left traces in every nook and cranny of your island, my Lord.
She's definitely here. Now, what worries me most, is why she doesn't show herself.
She's in hiding.
She seems to be making every effort to steer clear of your guests.
Wha...  what do you mean?
For the past few weeks my mother's been playing cat and mouse, if you will.
I don't know why but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that she's trying to avoid someone.
The question is who.
And in your opinion, would she be the cat or the mouse?
The cat.
Knowing my mother, she would be the cat.
The mouse.
I'd like to answer the cat. But unfortunately, I'm increasingly worried that she's in fact the mouse.
She does it often.
When I first came here, I wasn't that worried.
In the past my mother has taken a few liberties during her missions, including disappearing for several days on end.
That doesn't make me feel any better, Louis.
What was the official reason why my mother came to your island?
I knew about your mother's activities, and yours, in the Golden Order.
I thought we had everything to gain by working together.
You mean the cannon deal with Monsieur Bonaparte?
Among others, yes.
How did you hear about that?
Monsieur Bonaparte came to speak to me about it yesterday, during lunch.
I see. So impetuous.
He was supposed to let me speak to you about it first...
Our friend Napoleon desperately needed financial backing to properly equip his army.
I took it upon myself to back him because I've a firm conviction that he can go far.
Yet he told me that you had spoken and that you hadn't been able to reach an understanding.
That's putting it mildly.
Monsieur Bonaparte is one of those guys who only understands people who think like he does.
Ha, I see what you mean.
He is indeed rather inflexible when it comes to certain subjects.
But I am still of the opinion that you can manage to get along.
We shall see. However, there's one thing that surprises me.
Did my mother sell arms?
Did my mother intend to finance a war? I'm not sure that I follow...
No, your mother's aim was not so much to partake in a war but rather to make Monsieur Bonaparte accountable.
France is in turmoil and having support of a military man can often come in handy, Louis.
You'll see.
Why help a lieutenant?
Isn't Bonaparte a bit young to deserve so much attention?
Well, you come straight to the point. I like that.
Indeed, if you knew just how much you remind me of him.
Trust me. I wager that Monsieur Napoleon will soon prove himself. I'm working on it, at least.
Once this deal was closed, I had big plans for Sarah.
Such as what?
You see, I've invited several influential figures on my island to present them with a project at the conference.
It will be presented later today. I thought that the Golden Order had a role to play...  and I still think so.
I was hoping Sarah would be able to join us.
I see...
Indeed, if by chance, your mother decided not to return to us before the conference, would you do me the great honor of attending?
If only to follow the deliberations while waiting for her to duly take her seat.
Why not, we shall see.
Ah! Thank you so much.
In this way, you'll be able to keep your mother informed of what is said.
...  and...
There's something else I'd like to briefly go over:
Earlier, you asked me the official reason for your mother's presence here.
Is there an off-the-record reason why your mother came here?
I've absolutely no idea.
If only my mother had trusted me...  but she remained very mysterious...
I'd have been delighted to answer your question.
Is this usual for her?
As head of the Order, secrets are her bread and butter, as you can imagine.
That said, it's the first time she hasn't let me in on the reason for her trip.
And it intrigues me, to tell you the truth.
Well, I am sure that Sarah will explain everything once she reappears.
She was looking for a buyer.
She...  she was looking for someone.
Wha...  what do you mean?
In Paris, we were working on a smuggling case to do with occult objects.
We had just arrested a dealer who intended to go to you to meet a buyer.
My mother was here to find out to whom he intended to sell his stolen treasure.
Ah! What was the name of your dealer?
Von Borchert
The dealer was called Von Borchert.
As for the buyer, he was unknown to us.
Hmm...  No, I don't know anything about that.
Von Brochet
If I'm not mistaken, the dealer was called Von Brochet.
Name means nothing to me.
Von Brebis
He was called Von Brebis, if I remember rightly.
Does that ring a bell?
No, not in the slightest, sorry.
A Germanic name, I believe.
I can't remember exactly. Von...  something or other...
Von Wöllner?
No, not your friend, Mr von Wöllner.
There's something I still don't get.
In your opinion, why would your mother remain in hiding over several weeks?
Maybe she's wary of someone.
Her not coming back to the manor after so long, makes me wonder if she is wary of someone.
Certainly, but whom?
The only ones who were present during her stay were Sir Gregory, Duchess Hillsborrow, Mr von Wöllner and myself.
Duchesse Hillsborrow?
How did my mother and Duchess Hillsborrow get on?
Oh very well, I believe.
They spent a lot of time together. Without wanting to exaggerate, I rather got the impression that Emily reminded your mother of herself when she was young.
Was she wary of Gregory Holm?
It seems you're close friends, what...  what can you tell me about Sir Gregory?
Gregory? Oh, he's one of those cantankerous old men who hates losing at chess, he's a little eccentric, and rather conservative. I'm sure you've met the type.
Oh, actually, I don't judge people on how they look...
And you do well not to. What with his manner of continuing to wear makeup as he does, Gregory often gives off an unhealthy image.
He's an eccentric old man, a little stubborn, but what can you expect? He isn't going to change now, not at his age.
Was she wary of Wollner?
And what about Mr von Wöllner, do you know him well?
To be honest, not really. He's closer to Gregory. I'm not the one who invited him.
I know his reputation.
It is my understanding that he managed to form alliances with the right people at the right time.
Yes, apparently so.
It is my understanding that he didn't really get on with the previous prussian monarch, Frederick II, the father of the current King..
But he was clever enough to position himself with his son, the current King of Prussia, Frederick William.
Let Mortimer speak.
What I know of him is what they say in high society's salons. He's a man who manages to form alliances with the right people when it's necessary.
As a minister of the church, he actively repressed the religions of the Book and the spirit of the Enlightenment.
And if I'm not mistaken, he has a passion for alchemy.
But then, I must admit he is rather evasive and not very talkative, at least toward me.
I'd like to have a word with him, if I get the chance. He might be able to tell me more about my mother's last days with you.
Was she wary of Mortimer?
My Lord, I'm obliged to ask this question but please don' t take offense to it.
Ah, you wonder if Sarah was wary of me?
...
It just so happens that I've been asking myself the very same question. Because I can't explain why Sarah didn't come to see me, knowing how influential I am.
But to your point, I can't imagine she would be. Although I am obviously not the best person to answer that question.
Thank you.
I...  I had to ask.
Adams was here as well.
You forget Elizabeth Adams, my Lord.
That's true, but Gregory and I arranged it so that they wouldn't run into each other. I...  I thought it had worked.
Do you think that your mother felt she was in danger because of Elizabeth?
It's possible.
She might have discovered something.
Maybe she found something out?
What do you mean?
My mother has a gift for investigating.
If she had picked up a lead, nothing would have stopped her...
Maybe she's lost her mind.
I'd like to find a logical answer but I just can't see anything.
Apart from the fact that she might have lost her mind.
Since I came here, I've ceased to understand her. That, plus what I've found out about her past, and I'm left with the bitter feeling that I never really knew her.
I can understand you beginning to feel that way, after these past two days...
But I'm sure all will become clear once your mother reappears.
The only thing I can tell you is that Sarah had indeed changed.
At the beginning of her stay here, we enjoyed spending time together, solving the world's problems.
Enough about her, what of her disappearance?
Tell me...  tell me about her disappearance.
What did you speak about together?
You seem to know my mother very well, my Lord.
What did you talk about together?
Oh, as soon as we had a little free time, we liked to share points of view about practically any subject.
We would find ourselves embarked on interminable discussions that could go from Monsieur Blanchard's flight in a hot-air balloon to the treaty of Jassy...
Or the adoption of the metric system in France last year, or even Mr Eli Whitney's invention in the United States.
Whitney's cotton gin.
Ah, yes, his famous cotton gin.
It was supposed to revolutionize cotton production in the United States.
It will revolutionize the world, Louis.
The potential of this invention is much greater.
Tomorrow, all industries will be switching to simple but large-scale production, of that I'm sure!
The Treaty of Jassy.
The armistice between the Russians and the Turks.
Russia has come out of it having officially won Crimea, which gives it direct access to the Black Sea...
And at the same, the Mediterranean Sea.
I'm worried about the decisions Tsarina Catherine might decide to take.
She's a woman who managed to get rid of her husband to accede to the upper reaches of power...
Gaining access to the Mediterranean Sea remains her main objective.
When she still had that dear Potemkin as her lover, I could always find out about her intentions, but those days are over.
Grigory Potemkin?
You are speaking of Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin?
The very man: the little devil behind the Mother of all Russians.
Since his death, I know absolutely nothing of what the Tsarina is up to.
Oh, really?
Ah...  yes. I didn't meant to shock you, please forgive me.
Let's just say that in my position, it is often advantageous to know about the habits and customs of world leaders.
Who are they?
Please excuse me but I'm not very familiar with the Russian nobility.
Fascinating
My mother must have undoubtedly taken great pleasure in these exchanges, she always was one to appreciate broadening her knowledge.
I'm surprised that she didn't get you started on the crusades, it was her favorite subject.
Are you joking?
Sarah and I spent entire days together reliving them.
It so happens that the crusades are also my subject of predilection, especially the third.
My ancestor distinguished himself brilliantly during the siege of Saint Jean d'Acre.
The famous papal bull of Pope Gregory VIII.
Mother lulled my childhood with tales of the crusades.
How Richard the Lionheart and Philip Augustus had to battle it out to achieve their ends...
And how Guy de Lusignan, having broken his word, launched the siege of Saint Jean d'Acre.
I see Sarah's lessons have inspired new enthusiasts.
Good on you, because not everyone can claim they know as much at your age.
I know nothing of the crusades.
Unfortunately, my Lord, the crusades are not my chosen field.
Well, it doesn't matter. You have plenty of time to learn.
Your mother is a very well-read woman.
You're quite lucky to have her as a model, Louis.
Yes, I know...  but I'm still very worried.
I must admit, there are worse things to worry about now, Louis.
What do you mean?
Since she disappeared, your mother has been seen once.
Her behavior on the evening of your arrival greatly surprised Gregory and myself.
She resurfaced to attack Emma, Emily Hillsborrow's twin sister, and she shot her with a pistol.
Then, before Gregory could intervene, she ran off and disappeared again.
I beg you pardon? Hang on...
Emily has a twin sister? Who knew my mother? What's she playing at, goddammit!
That means...  My vision on the wharf: it w...  it was actually happening inside the manor.
Mother shot Emily's sister, the very person she came looking for! Why would she do that?
Excuse me, but between that and the childhood of Lady Adams, it's...  it's all a bit much for me to cope with...
I need to piece it all together again to see things more clearly.
You said that you spent a lot of time talking together "at the beginning". What happened for that to change?
I'm afraid I...  I haven't much to tell you. The more the days went by, the more she withdrew into herself. She never gave me an explanation.
Until the day came when she purely and simply disappeared.
Where...  where did she go when she wanted to be alone?
She would shut herself away in a room we use as a box room, upstairs.
Would...  would you allow me to go there?
Naturally, Louis, of course.
I'll send you a servant to open it.
Thank you...
One last thing, although I don't know if there is a connection...
I'm listening.
A gate was forced the other night near the wharf. Nothing serious, just a few small things damaged.
Excuse yourself
Sorry, my Lord...  but I was searching for leads to my mother.
I thought I was hot on her trail and didn't take any precautions.
Well, you could have reported it to a servant.
But never mind, I shall put it down to your ardor and anxiety...
However, please try to respect my estate in future.
I certainly will. Please accept my sincerest apologies.
Lie to him.
Uhuh...  I see, I might be about to find a trace of her passage...
Sorry, Mother, but I don't want him on my back! You'll have to take the blame for me.
I can't see how Sarah could have done this but then I can't think of any other solution either.
I'll take a closer look.
That's all I can tell you about the disappearance of your mother, Louis, I would like to have been more helpful.
I shall stay on her trail and follow up any leads.
Thank you. Er, we will meet later on to welcome our last guest.
In the meantime, I shall get someone to open the box room upstairs for you.
Thank you.
Right. It's time we spoke about your mother, Louis.
She isn't missing.
She isn't missing, you know.

The label shows that  this laudanum comes straight from America.
I wonder if Washington's involved?

Large quantities can knock out a bull.
Could Elizabeth have been drugged?
If the body wounds are anything to go by, then clearly not. She put up a fierce fight.

If it was smashed during the murder, then I've just established the time of the crime.
That would clear Emily de facto, because she was still with me at the time.

A pentagram.
What the hell's been going on here?
Examine the symbol
Contrary to what most people believe, a pentagram is not there to conjure up I don't know what evil, or demonic creature.
With the point toward the top, the pentagram is an ancient symbol of protection against evil.
I remember Mother's books.
Many esoteric rituals are based on this shape.
Could Elizabeth have been sacrificed during an occult ritual?
What's the connection with Elizabeth's death?
I wonder if Elizabeth's death has anything at all to do with this pentagram.
If a ritual went wrong and degenerated, Elizabeth would probably have been killed in the center of the pentagram.
Not three meters from here...  That's strange...

The blade
The blade is short and thin. Well sharpened, apparently.
It's covered in blood, still fresh... 
The handle
The lower part of the handle is unsullied by blood.
The murderer gripped the weapon so tight that there's no blood where he held it.
The hand print indicates a small and slender hand... 
Analyze the knife
The hand print on the handle is really small.
I can't imagine a man with a hand that size...  It must be from a woman's hand.

A knocked over bottle of wine... 
Smell
*sniff* What kind of plonk is that? Hey, it's a Bordeaux...  That's a Château Haut-Brion, that's a great wine... 
*sniff* Pwah!!! Same thing Elizabeth served me last night...  Still just as disgusting... 
I don't know what's happened to this wine but it's undrinkable.

I know that smell. It's laudanum. It must have been mixed with the wine directly in the bottle.

Yes
I know enough now, thank you.
Very well, sir. Sir may return whenever need be, I shall guard the door.
No
No, I haven't gone over everything yet.
Sir may take his time. When Sir would like to leave, Sir has only to tell me.
Who made such a mess of this room?
Do you know who could have made such a mess of this room?
Miss Adams, sir. We were given orders to leave the room as it was so as not to rush her.
Did she have a fight with someone to get the room into this state?
Not that I know of, sir. Miss Adams would sometimes throw a tantrum during which she would destroy anything that came to hand.
Lord Mortimer told us not to enter the room.
Thanks for that information.
You are welcome, sir.

Hey! A new note! It's been folded carefully in the corner of this page! The writing...  it's not my Mother's!
“S,
I found the book in your effects; I've concealed it where no one can get their hands on it, I can assure you!
Awaiting your instructions. I will hear your reply like he who hears the angel.”
Hears the angel? What does that mean? It's probably the place where she was expecting to get the location of the next note...

Analyze the book
What is it?
A volume of the Gutenberg Bible.
A Gutenberg Bible...
This book is incredibly precious.
I believe this is the book my mother referred to when calling upon the Lord...
This Bible is famous
This volume dates from the first edition of Gutenberg. It's the first book that was ever printed!
The pages are covered in annotations in Latin, French and Hebrew...  someone spent years studying this bible.

Leave
I've come to speak about the findings of the investigation, my Lord.
I'm listening, Louis.
Remind me of the facts we already know.
Will you remind me of the facts we already know about?
Elizabeth Adams was killed last night.
But Piaggi was with Holm and I, until late at night.
As for Bonaparte and Washington, they left us after midnight, both tired.
I have a culprit.
I believe I've identified the murderer.
Really, Louis? All right then. Please think carefully before you give me your answer. This is a very very serious accusation.
It's one of the male guests.
Jacques Péru
It would appear that Monsieur Péru is the culprit.
Hmm...  what proof do you have against him?
He had a fight with her.
He hit her before yesterday evening, his Eminence Piaggi can testify to that fact.
Ah, very interesting. Anything else?
He left his pistol at the scene.
His weapon was in Elizabeth's room, which proves he was present at the scene of the crime...
Hmm, I see. What else?
I found a pistol at the scene.
I found a pistol, engraved with the liberators of France, near Elizabeth's body.
Péru participated in the French Revolution, so he must be the owner, which goes to prove he was at the scene of the crime...
Napoleon Bonaparte took part too.. It could very well belong to him...  Anything else?
Giant footprint
I found a footprint in the victim's blood; the size corresponds to a very tall man.
Hmm, that's certainly suspicious.
I sense it was him.
I'm convinced he is guilty.
Yes, well, your instinct isn't enough to turn a suspect into a culprit, Louis.
That's sufficient.
I believe there's enough here to prove his guilt.
Very well. I'll share your conclusion with Gregory and then I shall take care of everything from now on.
Given the eminent guests and the important political issues involved, I trust you will leave me to conclude the case in my own way.
Wollner
It's Wöllner.
Hmm...  what proof do you have against him?
He was in love with her.
I found out that he was in love with Elizabeth. As the feeling wasn't mutual, he could have attacked her out of spite.
Without any proof of what Adams really thought, it's a weak motive. Anything else?
Wollner tried to make me speak about Adams.
He did try to squeeze information out of me about Adams.
Just as any worthy guest would do. Have you anything else?
They had an affair.
Elizabeth and Wöllner had an affair right here, which came to an end. I haven't been able to determine who put an end to it, though.
What my guests do in their beds is no concern of mine.
But I shall take note as jealousy can indeed often lead to folly. Anything else?
That's sufficient evidence to my mind.
No, I think that's enough to accuse him.
It's a bit light, but I shall speak to Gregory about it and compare your findings with other information.
Given the distinguished guests and the political issues involved at the conference, I trust you will leave me to conclude the case in my own way.
He has the look of a conspirator about him.
I don't trust the look of the man, I'm...  I'm sure that he's plotting something and that he could well have killed Adams...
We all turn into a wolf one day or another, but that's neither proof nor fact, just a presumption...
Napoleon
I think Monsieur Napoleon is the culprit...
Hmm, why is that?
The pistol.
I found a pistol belonging to a French fighter on the floor of Adams' room.
Napoleon isn't the only one to have fought for France here...  Péru also took part in fighting during the French Revolution. Anything else?
There are rumors of an affair with Adams.
It's possible he had an affair with the young Elizabeth. Things may have...  well, gotten out of hand between them and caused the attack...
It sounds a bit weak, but it could indeed be a motive. Anything else?
He looks like a killer.
Napoleon is a deceitful upstart, he'll do anything to gain power...
The very fact that he will do anything means that he will not risk offending me. He would have everything to lose by making me his enemy...
There is sufficient evidence for me.
That's it.
I have heard you out...
I shall investigate on my side...  but I have sincere doubts about this accusation.
Given the imminence and the political issues of the conference, I trust you will leave me to conclude the case in my own way.
Cardinal Piaggi
I...  I think it's Piaggi.
What? You think it could have been Cardinal Piaggi who killed her?
He gave me false leads.
His Eminence was of no help, he even gave me information that turned out to be false...
Louis, that doesn't authorize you to accuse him of murder...  Besides, he spent the best part of the night with Holm and myself, he has a solid alibi.
The wounds are not very deep
The cardinal is no longer a young man and the wounds on Elizabeth's body are shallow. He's probably the assassin.
An interesting deduction, but according to that logic, a woman might also be the culprit...  Anything else?
It's my firm conviction.
Contrary to my mother, I have little esteem for members of the church. He could very well have killed her...
No, I meant to say...
It's one of the female guests.
My mother...
From what I've found out, I...  I...  I believe that my mother is the culprit, even though I find it hard to accept...
Sarah? But why her?
Her violent past with Elizabeth.
I found out that there was a...  a long history between Elizabeth and my mother. She had been her personal doctor and had tortured her throughout her childhood...
Ah! And so, she could have tried to silence Elizabeth so the truth wouldn't get out and damage her reputation? It's possible. Have you anything else?
Elizabeth thought that Mother was going to kill her.
Elizabeth thought that Mother was going to kill her.
Difficult to believe in a simple coincidence in light of recent events...
Indeed, it's uncanny...  anything else?
The piece of dress
I found a piece of fabric that appears to have belonged to her and proves she was present at the scene of the crime.
Interesting, anything else?
The murderer is a woman.
The print left on the knife near the body was left by a slender hand, without a doubt the hand of a woman.
And there aren't many female guests...  I see. Anything else, Louis?
An intuition
My instincts tell me that it was my mother who killed Elizabeth...
You accuse your own mother of murder based on an intuition?
It seems to me that I have committed an error by entrusting you with this investigation, Monsieur de Richet.
I think that's sufficient evidence.
I think that there is more than enough evidence here.
Indeed. It's very worrying. Everything seems to indicate that your mother is responsible for Elizabeth's murder.
Given the distinguished guests and the political issues involved at the conference, I trust you'll leave me to conclude the case in my own way.
Now that we've examined the question from all sides, maybe you could explain to me why you asked me here, my Lord?
Emily Hillsborrow
Emily Hillsborrow is the guilty party.
Emily? Why?
The woman's hand print.
The knife found beside Elizabeth's body had the print of a slender hand on it, without a doubt the hand of a woman.
Ah! And there aren't many women among the guests...  Anything else, Louis?
The piece of dress
I found a piece of fabric that appears to have belonged to her. It means she was present at the scene of the crime.
Any other proof?
That's all I have.
Interesting...  Nothing conclusive, mind you but very interesting.
Coming from you, the accusation of Emily is...  surprising, Louis. I shall endeavor to solve this case myself.
Given the distinguished guests and the political issues involved at the conference, I trust you will leave me to conclude the case in my own way.
An intuition
I have nothing tangible, but I'm certain that she is the culprit.
You accuse Emily of murder based on an intuition...
Emily Hillsborrow's sister.
I think that Emily Hillsborrow's sister is the culprit.
So, you know the truth about them. What proof do you have to support your conclusion?
The hand print of a woman
The knife found beside Elizabeth's body had a hand print, from a slender hand that is, without a doubt the hand of a woman.
Hmm, there aren't many women among the guests...  Alright, anything else, Louis?
The piece of dress
I found a piece of fabric that appears to have belonged to her and, well, proves she was at the scene of the crime.
Hmm, interesting, anything else?
An intuition
I have nothing tangible, but I'm certain that she's the culprit.
You accuse someone of murder based on an intuition?
Emily has an alibi: me.
It can't be Emily because, well, we spent part of the night together...
Besides, to my mind no other woman has the capacity to do it.
An interesting alibi, although not very original. Anything else?
That's all.
Unfortunately, now you are going to find out why this assumption doesn't hold up.
The simple reason is this: your mother shot Emma on the night you arrived...
Are you joking? I...
My vision on the wharf...  the scene...  it took place as I was arriving!
I don't get it...
It perhaps won't come as a surprise to you but Emma and Emily shared the same identity in the eyes of the world.
They were more than just twins. They were the same person. Two members of the Order under the same name: Duchess Emily Hillsborrow.
So this is Emily's big secret: she's looking for her sister...  twin sister and partner! But why hide all this from me?
In any case, I've decided to take over the investigation from now on.
Emily has an alibi: Washington.
Emily's evening was...  busy. According to my information she even stayed to talk with Washington until the early hours of the morning.
Besides, to my mind no other woman has the capacity to do it.
An interesting alibi, even though not very original. Anything else?
Elizabeth Adams herself.
I believe it was suicide.
Suicide?!...  Louis, I...  I hope you have solid evidence...
The hand print of a woman
The knife found beside Elizabeth's body had a hand print on it, a slender hand, without a doubt the hand of a woman.
And Elizabeth is the only female guest?  Come, Louis...  Anything else?
She took drugs.
She overdid the laudanum and the wine. Probably to take away her anxiety. She could have decided she couldn't go on and acted while she was not her normal self...
Sounds a bit far-fetched to me, but it isn't without logic. Anything else?
She was self-harming.
She was covered in scars from previous acts of scarification. That proves that she was prone to harming herself. Her suicide was the culmination of this...
What you say makes sense, but it's a little weak...  Haven't you anything else?
That's my belief, that's all.
It is my conviction that she killed herself...
So she stabbed herself nine times? Really? That's very hard to believe, Louis.
No, I meant to say...
I must think it through.
I'm going to need a bit more time to review my findings about the crime...
I do understand...  All the more so as it's crucial not to make any mistakes when it comes to naming the culprit.
I have clues but prefer to not accuse anyone
I'm sorry, my Lord, but I don't have any evidence conclusive enough to allow me to name the culprit with certitude.
Really? I see...  well, that's your decision, Louis, and I accept it.
Given the distinguished guests and the sensitive political issues involved at the conference, I trust you'll leave me to conclude the case in my own way.
Goodbye.
I'll be in touch as soon as I have any more information...
Louis, I'm afraid this is simply not sufficient. This is a serious accusation, I need concrete evidence. That is why I am taking over this case, as of now.
I've come to speak about the findings of the investigation, my Lord.
I'm listening, Louis.
Remind me of the facts we already know.

The room is just opposite Mortimer's study.
The room is just opposite Mortimer's study.
Gregory, Louis told me we needn't be concerned..
Of course... 
Monsieur de Richet, the situation seems to escape your grasp, so I won't beat about the bush:
Did you kill Elizabeth Adams?
No, I did not!
What are you talking about? I... I only helped her!
We talked and...  she wanted to leave. I...  I imagine that's what she did, right?
We have found no trace of her leaving, Monsieur, so allow me to have my doubts.
Nor have we found any reason to believe that Louis is lying.
I don't remember
Everything's all mixed up in my head, I...  I'm sorry... 
Look...  We had a few drinks and...  I think I remember her putting laudanum in the wine and I...  I started getting dizzy... 
I don't remember anything about last night.
I don't think you could have provided a worse answer to that question.
Elizabeth is dead?
What? Elizabeth is dead?
No, now let us remain calm. We do not yet know, Gregory, precisely what has happened to our poor Elizabeth.
I beg your pardon!
So...  so what are...  what are you accusing me of, then?
We must remain calm, Gregory.
We have found no evidence that would suggest that Elizabeth has been murdered.
For the time being, she has only disappeared. Let's stick to the facts, if you please.
Well, where is she, then?
She must have gone home.
She's probably gone back home.
She didn't want to stay here any longer, she seemed very uncomfortable here.
Why imagine the worst?
Until there is evidence to the contrary, your mother is still lurking nearby and I dare not think what would happen were they to meet.
In fact, I don't know.
Last night when we talked, she said she felt uncomfortable here and spoke of leaving but didn't say where to.
Knowing Elizabeth, I am sure she must have spoken to you about your mother.
I don't see the connection.
What has my mother got to do with this?
Gregory is suggesting he isn't certain that Elizabeth has left the island and that some misfortune might well have befallen her during the night... 
But that's not the case.
That's what you say!
You are the last person who saw her alive.
There might well be any number of reasons why you wanted her silenced!
No one can substantiate your claim that she left as you said she did, Louis.
How would I know?
Technically, I...  I'm simply incapable of telling you where she might be.
And we never talked about her destination.
What I can say, is that the last time I saw Elizabeth, she was in her room... 
And she had just decided to leave the island.
Gregory, you must admit that just because Louis doesn't know where Elizabeth is, does not prove that something's happened to her.
Why does this matter to you?
With all due respect, gentlemen, what does any of this have to do with you?
It seems to me that Miss Adams is free to do whatever she pleases, isn't she?
No, Louis, Miss Adams was not free to do as she pleased.
No, Louis. You see, Elizabeth came here at my request in order to get some rest.
Certainly not so she could disappear in the middle of the night on a whim!
Please stop all of your verbal gymnastics. We can see very well that you still haven't answered the question.
Maybe at her sister's?
I'm not absolutely sure, but I'd wager she's gone to visit her sister.
I beg your pardon?
Good Lord!... 
Y...  You mean Abigail?
Yes, they've been keeping in touch by mail.. Elizabeth always dreamed of meeting her.
I wouldn't be surprised if she went to see her.
Damnation, William, This is a fiasco!
Sir, you don't seem to realize just how serious this is!
Let's try and remain calm, Gregory.
In any case, it would be far better if Elizabeth really has left the island as Louis says.
Why do you think she wanted to leave?
I advised her to.
She...  she couldn't bear it any more, she...  she was becoming hysterical and drinking heavily.
She was panic-stricken at the thought of staying here and I didn't know she wasn't allowed to leave.
It's not that she was a prisoner here, Louis.
But Elizabeth is mentally very fragile and I fear she might do something terrible to herself or others.
She wasn't ready and you have made a grave mistake by encouraging her.
William, don't justify yourself! He won't even answer the question.
What is the real reason, Monsieur de Richet?
She felt trapped here.
Sh...  she was persuaded she was going to die, when... 
When she saw that you had invited my mother, she thought that you wanted to put an end to her.
She felt betrayed.
But why didn't she speak to me about it?
Elizabeth had nothing to fear from us. You know very well who she was afraid of but you don't dare say.
To escape my mother.
She was terrorized by my mother's presence here.
Just the thought of coming face to face with her was unbearable... 
Did she tell you why?
Yes, she brought the subject up.
I'm sorry, Louis, it couldn't have been easy to hear.
For your sake, I sincerely hope that she got there safely.
William, I believe we have finished here.
Good
Monsieur de Richet, I apologize if my words seemed a little abrupt.
I dare not think what would happen if Elizabeth came across your mother on the island.
Your generosity may well cost you dearly.
I understand, my Lord, I certainly regret it... 
Bad
Monsieur de Richet, we have given you every opportunity to reassure us as to the fate of Elizabeth... 
You have only succeeded in plunging yourself into deeper trouble.
I will never rest until we are certain that Elizabeth is indeed alive.
I assure you, my Lord... 
We are obliged to believe you for the moment... 
Consequently, I shall make you a promise in return.
If ever we find out that anything has happened to poor Elizabeth,... 
... I shall personally see to it that your head will land in a basket!
Monsieur de Richet, you were found standing over Miss Adams' body.
We must shed some light on your responsibility in this tragedy.
We shall then decide on your fate, but you must know that if you do not convince us of your innocence... 
...  it will cost you dearly.
Now you're going to tell us everything that happened last night, without leaving any detail out.
First things first, how did your evening begin?
I was with Emily when Elizabeth turned up
Duchess Hillsborrow and I were returning to our rooms when Elizabeth came upon us.
Oh, so you were with the duchess?
Yes, we were talking. We were walking up the stairs and, it was late.
Where did you come from?
Errr...  I don't remember... 
Tell him the truth
We came from the Portrait Gallery, if I remember rightly.
Hmm...  That is what the Duchess said...  Continue.
Lie to him
We came from the small salon, I believe, and... 
Hmm...  And then?
From the Grand Hall
I...  I think we came from the Grand Hall.
Oh, isn't that surprising...  Do continue.
I don't remember.
Listen, with everything that's happened, my thoughts are a...  a bit mixed up. I...  I can't remember very well, I'm...  I'm sorry.
Now why does that answer not surprise me? But please, do go on... 
Elizabeth asked to speak to me.
I was in the corridor, and I was going to bed. Elizabeth wanted to speak to me because she feared for her life.
Very well. Continue.
Were you alone?
Don't lie to them, they know.
No, I was going upstairs with Duchess Hillsborrow, and we were walking towards our rooms when Elizabeth suddenly appeared.
Yes, I was alone
Indeed, it was late, I...  I was tired and I was going up to bed.
That's not what Duchess Hillsborrow told us.
You were apparently both going upstairs and Miss Adams accosted you.
What do you think will happen if we find you guilty?
Come, come, gentlemen.
Please continue your account, Louis.
Continue without answering Mortimer
Well, I...  I followed her, and... 
Louis...  you are trying to dodge the question.
Why try to hide the fact that you went up with Duchess Hillsborrow?
I'm finding it very difficult to follow your line of reasoning.
Never mind, continue.
You went upstairs, Elizabeth accosted you to beg for your help.
I was with Emily
I was alone
Elizabeth beckoned me to her room.
I was in the corridor, and I was about to go to bed.
Elizabeth appeared as if from nowhere and rushed toward me.
She took me by the arm and led me to her room.
You say she...  led you?
Alright...  we'll accept that. Continue.
We were heading for our rooms when Elizabeth burst into the corridor, barely dressed.
She was panic-stricken and insisted on speaking to me.
So I found myself in Elizabeth's room.
We sat down together. She insisted we have a drink or she would refuse to confide in me.
What exactly did she want to speak about at such a late hour?
About her childhood with my mother.
She was distressed, she... 
She'd just found out that I was Sarah de Richet's son and sort of insisted on telling me about the horrors my mother made her suffer.
She was convinced she was going to die.
It turns out she wasn't wrong.
She claimed she saw my mother the evening before.
She was panicked. She claimed she had just seen my mother on the island.
Did she say where she saw her?
In a cave.
I'm not sure but I think she spoke of a cave.
A cave? Hmm, strange.
On the pontoon.
If I remember correctly, she told me she saw her on the docks.
Your memory fails you, Sir.
She also told me, but she said she saw her near a cliff.
On the cliffs
Huh...  I seem to remember something about cliffs.
Let us continue.
Say she feared Mortimer
Well, she was terrorized by the fact that you invited her at the same time as my mother.
She was surely victim to misconceptions but felt trapped. She was convinced she was going to die.
But why?
Let's say she didn't believe in coincidences, shall we?
You'll admit that the chances of my mother and Elizabeth bumping into each other on this island are pretty slim.
Why did you invite them both at the same time?
Sorry if I'm putting my nose where it doesn't belong, my Lord, but why did you invite them at the same time?
Elizabeth spoke to you about her past.
She came here so you could help her fight her demons. She must have told you about her encounters with my mother.
Say nothing
... 
Remember, Louis, I was not the one who invited dear Elizabeth.
Indeed, it was me!
And you seem to forget it was you that we found right next to poor Elizabeth's body.
You had better start proving your innocence rather than trying to cast doubts on William here.
Tell them she was feeling better.
And believe it or not, Elizabeth extolled to me the virtues of her treatment.
She felt better and ready to cope with the ordeals of the outside world.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, she told me she had made peace with her old demons and was excited to begin her new life.
Ah, you see, Gregory, you were right to bring her here.
What a pity she was unable to benefit from it... 
She wanted to get me drunk.
Elizabeth made me drink, more and more, until I could hardly stand!
William, this young man is appalling.
Louis, given the seriousness of the situation you shouldn't try to pass yourself off as a victim.
How tactless!
She didn't threaten you if you wouldn't drink, did she? No one forced your hand.
Especially as it doesn't even answer the question.
And...  what happened next?
Then she told me she had poured laudanum in my glass.
The next minute I was on the floor.
When I woke up she was lying in a pool of blood.
That is all you have to say?
You expect us to believe that you have no idea what happened to her?
Yes, because I'm telling you the truth.
How can you possibly expect us to believe you?
Gregory, we must consider every possibility.
Louis, do you have any idea who could have done it?
Jacques Péru?
Why don't you ask him where he was last night.
Monsieur Péru? What would his motive be? Do you have any proof?
No, not exactly, but he'd already roughed her up once.
Monsieur de Richet, you should not accuse the first person to come along without at least some proof. I'm sure you are worthier than that!
Can you think of anyone else?
My mother.
Well, even if I can't believe for a single instant that my mother could have murdered someone in that manner... 
She might have wanted to stop Elizabeth from speaking about their mutual past.
And things might have turned nasty.
It is indeed a possibility.
It could have even been me.
Judging by the situation, I'm at the top of your list of suspects.
William gave you every opportunity to shift suspicion onto someone else... 
You have a very strange method of defending yourself, young man!
So, Louis, what would your motive be?
Well, given the abuse my mother inflicted on the young woman, I might have wanted to protect her reputation.
And tried to hush it up by getting rid of the only witness.
That makes sense.
But, thinking about it, it also makes your mother the ideal suspect... 
And since us suspecting you is not the best form of defence, do you want to try again?
I don't know.
Look, frankly, it's beyond me. I just don't know.
Monsieur de Richet...  don't you think it would be in your interest to help us find another suspect?
Washington
Maybe Mr Washington... 
But of course, and what would his motive be?
I believe he thought Elizabeth was stillborn.
Washington could have been trying to protect the secret of his vice president, Elizabeth's father... 
Sorry Louis, but it so happens that Mr Washington spent most of the time with Duchess Hillsborrow. She confirmed it.
Thank you for these elements.
Good outcome
I would like to thank you for helping us shed light on what happened last night.
To be honest, you are not the only suspect.
I'm prepared to believe you were drugged, our poor Elizabeth hid the stuff everywhere and I could smell laudanum on you three yards away.
So you knew it wasn't me from the start!
We weren't sure.
Louis, I am sorry but everything points in the same direction.
I only know one person on this island who might have had a big enough grudge against Elizabeth, who has no alibi, and whose behaviour is, well, suspect... 
who has no alibi and who behaves suspiciously... if not dangerously
Tell me what happened before my arrival, I think I've been patient enough.
Bad outcome
Let's finish this William.
I don't rightly know how we can give the benefit of the doubt to an individual who can manipulate the truth to absurdity!
Louis, unfortunately you haven't managed to convince us. You will agree that you had the time and the motive to commit the murder.
I...  I am devastated but I must agree with Gregory, and declare you guilty.
Gentlemen, if you please... 
Wait! There is something else... 
Go on, this is the time to talk.
Elizabeth ended up telling me why my mother had tried to treat her.
The voices in her head, is that it?
She spoke to you about them too, didn't she?
Gentlemen, I'm not a doctor but she was persuaded she heard voices...  in her head.
You don't think she might have killed herself, do you?
By stabbing herself nine times? I find that extremly unlikely, don't you?
What?...  stabbed nine times?
It appears that the murderer walked up and stabbed her several times form behind.
We counted nine gashes in all. All of them were relatively shallow and they were all given from roughly the same angle of attack.
Traces of blood appear to prove that she was standing throughout the attack.
Shallow slashes?
I might not have the strength of Hercules, but... 
If I had stabbed a woman, I'd probably have made deeper cuts.
Look at me, my clothes aren't even stained. How do you think I could have stabbed her without getting a single drop of blood on me?
I haven't changed clothes, search the manor, you'll find nothing of mine covered in blood. I didn't do it!
Sounds plausible.
You have no proof against me!
If that's all the proof you have before dispensing justice, then you'll have innocent blood on your hands.
There's no proof I...  I could have committed the murder.
You do know, Sir, that the first impression is often the right one.
We found you near dear Elizabeth's body. What could be simpler?
I have to admit, you put forward a powerful argument, Monsieur de Richet.
I think that will be all, Gregory...  the benefit of the doubt suffices.
Louis, I shan't hide the fact that this tragedy puts me in a very delicate situation.
I cannot risk upsetting the smooth operation of our next conference.
But the case cannot remain unaddressed
What does he intend to do?
I understand. What do you intend to do?
Let him finish
I must reassure my guests and Justice will be done.
And for that to happen, I must ask for your help.
Why is that?
You met Elizabeth. You spoke together, I believe. She trusted you.
Listen, Louis. Find out who could have committed this murder. I refuse to believe that one of my guests is the murderer.
I want to know who is responsible for this and I trust you.
You have my backing. You must stop at nothing. Can I count on you?
Of course. How would you like me to proceed?
Start by searching the poor woman's room.
Maybe you can start by going to the scene of the crime. Elizabeth was attacked in her room.
Are there any suspects?
Do you have any suspects in mind, my Lord?
I spent most of the night talking with Sir Gregory and his Eminence Piaggi.
So I think you can remove them from the list of suspects.
Monsieur Bonaparte and President Washington left the party after midnight, I believe. They were tired and went up to bed.
Any details about this tragedy?
Can you tell me anything else about what happened?
No, Louis, I wouldn't want to influence you. Get over there and form your own opinion.
Go there.
Right, I'll get over there immediately.
Thank you, Louis. Once you've finished, come back and let me know your findings, I'll be waiting.
And Louis, you got permission to search through the guests' rooms. They've all been notified and they all agree.
A notebook...  written in Elizabeth's handwriting.
It is written in a mix of several languages...  not too easy to work out... 
Translate the text
It looks like a mixture of medieval Latin and Anglo-Norman... 
It is difficult to make sense of this jerky writing, I can make out some passages though... 
"He's coming"...  "The demon is upon me"
"He's coming back to kill me...  there she is!"
"Death has come to finish me off, I've just run into her son"
That was her last entry...  what tortured writing... 
Use your knowledge
It's medieval Latin. I know enough enough to translate a bit.

A piece of fabric, high quality at that: I'd say it's silk...
Going by the texture and the gray hue it must come from a dress, that kind that women of quality wear.
For the nobility clothes make the man...  or the woman...
It's a travel dress, the silk has been lightly waxed to protect it from bad weather...
And I know the very woman who came up with the idea, given all the traveling she does: my mother...
God help us! Why did she come here in the first place?
The material appears to have undergone abnormal wear and tear...  she must have been scouring the countryside and that doesn't look good...
Let's see what it reminds me of...
The color doesn't correspond to Emily's black outfits, and Elizabeth doesn't have anything quite like this in her wardrobe...
Let's take a closer look...
It's a little dirty...  It must come from the bottom of the dress where it touches the ground...
I recognize that moiré pattern: it's the same as the travel dress my mother was wearing when she left!
But why the hell did she come into this room?

A pistol, fairly new I'd say... and judging by the weight of it, fairly light... 
Examine the firearm
A tribute engraved on the barrel... 
"To the liberators of France"
Observe the grip
Mmm...  There's a few dried traces of blood on the grip.
Difficult to know for sure how they got there... 
Check inside the barrel
It's extremely well maintained, the barrel is perfectly clean... 
It isn't loaded and there's no traces of gunshot residue... 
I conclude that it hasn't been used recently.

Monsieur de Richet. Please be quick, we are both very busy.
Question him over last night.
Did you hear about young Elizabeth?
Indeed. It is deeply regrettable.
Lord Mortimer asked me to...
I know. You no doubt want to know my alibi.
I spent the night downstairs playing cards.
Who with?
Can you tell me who was present at the game, please?
Well...  There were Lord Mortimer, President Washington and Sir Gregory.
Thank you.
Ah! And his Eminence Piaggi as well. Excuse me, I nearly forgot him, poor soul.
Did anyone leave early?
Did any of you leave during the game?
Not that I know of, monsieur.
I didn't exactly spend my time noting the other guests comings and goings, but I don't think so.
Thank you.
Did anything happen out of the ordinary?
Did you notice anything unusual during the evening?
Nothing at all, except the luck of the devil of Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory at cards.
Did they win much?
Ohlala, monsieur, they cleaned us out, more like! But I plan on getting it all back before we leave.
Until what time?
What time did the game end?
I can't say exactly.
As for me, I must have stayed until midnight.
I was exhausted, couldn't think straight. So I preferred to go up to bed.
On your way up to bed, did you notice anything out of the ordinary?
No, not in the least. The whole manor was sound asleep.
Not really, no...
Never mind...
Does he own a pistol?
As any good soldier would, I imagine you own a firearm. May I see it?
Oh, well, if you really want to, here is my pistol. Don't worry, it is not loaded.
Do you have several of these?
In Corsica, oui, but not on me when I am traveling. Only a bandit would carry such an arsenal.
Thank you.
He was seen lurking around Elizabeth's room.
Someone saw you not far from the victim's room. Can you tell me what you were doing exactly, please?
I can tell you that "someone" is an idiot.
I wanted to warn her to be careful. You see, on the night of my arrival I saw someone leaving her room in haste.
And I wanted to speak to her, to warn her. Unfortunately, the young lady slipped through my fingers each time.
Now I know why. She had every reason to be worried.
What an idiot I was not to insist! I could have helped her!
Did you recognize the prowler?
Were you able to recognize the prowler?
Unfortunately not, no. It was dark and Lord Mortimer was waiting for me. I was not really paying attention, anyway.
Not a single detail?
Excuse me for insisting but if you saw him or her, I'm sure you would have more information than that.
It's just that you don't think it can be of help to me.
What do you mean?
I don't know. Was it a woman, for instance? Bearing in mind that all the women here, wear whalebone dresses, which is rather noticeable.
A man, I should say. I don't recall seeing the silhouette of a dress.
You see, you saw many things, in fact.
Hang on, laissez moi réflechir, let me think a minute.
A wig? His height? The sound of his footsteps, maybe?
Ah, his height! Oui, somewhat imposing. A tall man, and straight. As for the rest, I don't know, Monsieur de Richet.
Not to worry. That's already quite a lot. Thank you for everything
The night of her arrival...
But if I remember rightly, the night of her arrival was also the night of MY arrival.
So the person he saw leaving Elizabeth's room...
... was Washington!
Continue...
Is he sincere?
I've been studying him for a while now and I don't think he was lying.
Yet, I'm surprised how easy it was for me to read him. Must surely be his military side.
I wish they all could be like that. My investigation would be finished already.
Continue...
Leave
Well, have we finished, monsieur?
Exactly. Thanks again for all your answers. Good day.

It looks like a note between Emily and Washington about trade deals.
decipher the letter
The English and the Americans are preparing a peace treaty... 
It would appear that Emily is in secret discussions with Washington about reopening trade between the United States and England.
If such an arrangement came into being, France would suffer dearly.

Your Eminence.
I imagine that you've heard the news about Miss Adams?
What a tragedy, my son! How could such a thing have happened?
That's exactly what I'm trying to find out. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary last night?
I saw the young French soldier, Bonaparte, I believe, hanging around near Miss Adams' room.
But I would not want to get an innocent man into trouble, Louis. It's probably nothing.
Does he know why?
Not to worry, your Eminence. If he is innocent, then he has nothing to fear.
Do you know why Monsieur Bonaparte was hanging around her room like that?
Well, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that a dashing, young soldier had become infatuated with a fragile young woman, who looked a bit lost... 
But I don't think he got a very warm welcome.
Bonaparte and Adams? But they didn't even know each other, did they?
I couldn't say, Louis.
Anything else?
But if I were you, my son, I would talk to Monsieur Péru.
You remember how violently he set upon Miss Adams.
Oh, don't worry, he's on the list of suspects.
One last thing, you must know that Péru hit young Adams on the evening of our arrival.
He apparently violently attacked her in the small salon.
Do you know anything else about the attack?
Oh, unfortunately not. I arrived too late to intervene. Young Miss Adams had already been submitted to the foul lout's wrath.
Otherwise, you can believe me, it would not have happened!
What can I do for you, de Richet?
Monsieur, Lord Mortimer has appointed me to investigate the tragedy that befell us last night.
Oh, yes, it's horrible, yes.
How can I help, monsieur?
Where was he last night?
Where were you last night?
In my room. I read a few ancient manuscripts before going to bed, but I didn't stay up long. I was tired.
Thank you kindly.
I know they had a relationship.
Excuse me for asking, but did you know Miss Adams?
Oh, she...  er...  not really, to tell the truth. No.
I found the Werther dedication, signed by your hand, monsieur. Would you like to change your version now?
Be careful, de Richet! Don't push your luck!
My relationship with Miss Adams was pure and has nothing to do with you.
Continue playing the detective as you see fit, but if I find the bastard who did that to Elizabeth, I will... 
Yes, I would have preferred a simple response, but I see I have my answer now... 
How long did your relationship last?
Exactly how long had you been seeing her?
I have no reason to answer you.
I see, is that what you want me to tell Lord Mortimer when he asks what I've found out?
It's...  it's only been a few weeks!
Was your relationship over?
I get the impression that your romance was over. Am I right?
So? What does it matter to you? I would never have attacked her, if that's what you're insinuating!
Who put an end to the relationship? You or her?
It was her! It was her. But what does that matter, we both agreed.
Did you love her?
You loved her, didn't you?
That is none of your damn business!
Your feelings betray you, sir.
So what! Yes, I loved her, like a moth loves the flame of a candle!
That's why we could never be together!
The nature of your relationship!
Please, tell me a little more about the nature of your relationship.
That is a personal matter, monsieur!
Yes, that is true. So, tell me.
Alright, it was passion! That's why we couldn't stay together. It scared her.
I know enough... 
Learn more about Elizabeth's tattoos.
Did you see how many tattoos Miss Adams had on her?
Of course. Who wouldn't have noticed?
Yes, but I'm sure that an expert like yourself must have an opinion on the subject.
I do. She was seeking to imprison something inside her. Her own body had become a sort of...  prison.
She wanted to protect herself, is that what you're saying?
Elizabeth was a flame. A candle in the night.
And like all candles in the night, she was surrounded by darkness, by her demons. Call it what you will.
One thing is for sure, she struggled against hell and high water not to let her flame go out.
Leave
We finished. I'll have a look around and then take my leave.
Do whatever you have to do.
Good day, Monsieur de Richet.
Mr Wöllner...  are you looking for anything in particular? Next to Elizabeth's room?
I...  I...  No...  no, I...  nothing special... 
Insinuate that he looks dodgy.
I'd have thought...  This is not really the shortest way to get to your suite.
Yes...  I...  I wasn't really looking where I was going.
Speak about Elizabeth's death.
Has anyone told you that Elizabeth was killed last night?
I...  Yes...  rumors spread quickly... 
He looks very put out... 
It's...  it's horrible...  how did it happen?
I can say nothing to you, sir...  You'd better follow your host's instructions and stay in your quarters.
Don't tell him anything for the time being
You ought to go back to your room, as Lord Mortimer asked you to... 
And may I know why you yourself are not in your quarters?
For very sad reasons, sir, which only concern Lord Mortimer, the only person I'm accountable to.
Well, look at you, the new right-hand man...  I see.
What is he doing in the corridor?
Lord Mortimer must have informed you of the necessity for everyone to remain in their rooms until further notice... 
Certainly, but I'm a guest, not a prisoner!
I was looking for a servant since we don't all, unfortunately, have one at our disposal!
Yeah right!
I shall leave you now, sir. I will return to my room!

The Sorrows of Young Werther.
There's a handwritten text signed by Von Wöllner on this first page:
"Dear Elizabeth, I know that this book is but a small token compared to the delightful moments you gave me.
But I hope that this will nonetheless keep the memory alive. Your ever obedient servant."
So, Wöllner had a relationship with Elizabeth... 
But that's hardly surprising given his fondness for the occult.

You have cleared your name in the eyes of your guests
I failed to convince the judges of my innocence
I understood what my mother's message is about
I did not understand my mother's message
I discovered my mother's message
I searched Lord Mortimer's study
I could have searched Lord Mortimer's study

I managed to access the derelict room

Lord Mortimer's office
January 22nd, 1793
William, I would like to see you a moment before we begin.
In private... 
Let's step outside a moment... 
Louis, this will only take a few moments... 
Search the study
Alright, let's take this chance to look around.
Wait
I'd better not make myself look more suspicious than I already do.

I'd better not make myself look more suspicious than I already do.
You don't need us for any of this. So, come along monsieur Péru. We are leaving.
What can I do for you, Louis?
I've come to see you about last night's tragedy.
Did you hear anything about what happened to Elizabeth?
Yes, we all did. Rumors spread quickly, you know.
How awful...
I didn't know her well, but I hope at least the poor thing didn't suffer too much.
Probably not.
She didn't have time. I'm afraid Miss Adams was stabbed several times.
Good God...  what a tragedy.
Stabbed nine times...
Elizabeth was stabbed nine times. No doubt she suffered greatly.
Nine times...  what monster is capable of such a horrible thing?
Don't you worry.
Death came quickly, you can be assured of that.
If such a senseless act can happen here, then none of us is truly safe anywhere.
Lord Mortimer must be mortified that one of his guests could have committed such an act, don't you think?
He is indeed very upset about it. That's only natural after such a violent murder.
Violent, what do you mean?
Elizabeth was stabbed nine times.
Oh my God, Louis! How awful!
The murderer must have had a serious grudge against her to set upon her like that. It must have been a crime of passion.
Do you know what happened exactly?
In fact, Lord Mortimer has asked me to look into this case, Emily.
Really! Are you Lord Mortimer's snoop now?
I'm doing it for Elizabeth. Not to please Mortimer.
Good for you. Quite right, too. Have you found out anything?
Where was she last night?
I'm now interviewing all the guests to establish the alibis for each person.
Just so I can cross you off the list of suspects, can you tell me what you did after leaving my room?
You know, the easiest way to find out what I was doing last night would have been to invite me to stay, Louis.
But I shall answer you. I simply went back to my room and then to bed.
On the way, I stopped off for a brief chat with President Washington about some business that concerns both of us.
Very well, then. Thank you, Emily.
Just so that I can cross you off the list of suspects, can you tell me what you were doing on the night of the murder?
Am I given to understand that I'm on the list of suspects?
Don't take it the wrong way but I must consider every possibility.
Well, if you absolutely wanted to be sure of my activities that evening, you only had to join me, you know.
I know, Emily. Especially since I couldn't prevent the murder, even though I spent part of the evening with Elizabeth.
You...  you sure it's not too hard to bear for you?
The fact is, I don't have a choice...
But I will find the murderer! I owe Elizabeth that, at least.
Just so that I can cross you off the list of suspects, can you tell me what you did after leaving my room?
Are you including me among the suspects? After the night we spent together?
Careful, Louis. Keep this up and I'll call you a cad.
I don't doubt your innocence, Emily, but I still need proof for Lord Mortimer.
I didn't think you'd want me to explain to him where you spent the night, actually.
Ah! Good thinking, my friend. Tell Mortimer that I went to talk with President Washington, he'll be able to corroborate what I say.
I went to see him after leaving you. We had some things to discuss concerning a business matter.
Perfect.
Make her speak about the night of the murder.
Since your arrival, did you notice anything strange about Elizabeth?
Everything that happened around that poor child was strange. You saw that for yourself...
I know, you're right.
I'm looking for leads to try to reduce the number of suspects.
Well, I would say that in addition to ourselves, you could also cross off President Washington.
I went to see him during the night, I had some business with him and I can confirm that he didn't leave his room all night.
That gives Washington an alibi.
What was her relationship with Elizabeth?
Did you and Elizabeth get to know each other?
Hmm...  I must admit, Louis, I...  I didn't take much interest in her.
I feel a bit guilty about it, but I never actually spoke to her.
She seemed burdened by her problems and as she wasn't invited to the conference, I didn't really seek her out.
Others...
Speak to her about her correspondence with Piaggi.
I hear you were in discussions with the Holy See?
Oh! Either his Eminence can't keep his tongue from wagging, or you've been poking your nose where you shouldn't, sir.
Even so, Emily, you're raising a royalist army. That's no small matter.
And you are straying from the subject. Is there anything else you wanted to ask me?
Speak to her about her arrangements with Washington.
Tell me, Emily, what's the nature of your relationship with Washington?
Oh, come off it, Louis, you're not going to go into a jealous rage, are you?
No, I can assure you of that, that has nothing to do with it.
I saw Washington's letter!
You're preparing a treaty to break the ties between the United States and France.
Whatever are you talking about, Louis?
I read your correspondences, Emily.
It's not what you think. So don't go thinking there's anything personal in it.
Are you trying to break Franco-American agreements, Emily?
That's the job, Louis. We're all doing everything we can to serve the best interests of our nation.
It's got nothing to do with you, or us.
But why didn't you tell me about it before?
Would you have told me?
Let her speak.
It doesn't really matter...  Look, Louis, the President and myself are working on a number of commercial contracts. Nothing overly exciting.
You're lying, Emily...  if these agreements come into being, they'll break Franco-American alliances for the greatest benefit of England.
In order to know.
Speak to her about the piece of fabric.
I found a torn piece of dress in Miss Adams' room. Grey silk.
Where's it from?
That's what I'm trying to find out. The color doesn't match any of Elizabeth's dresses, but I might not have found all of her clothes yet.
Good Lord, Louis...  I...  do you realize what this means?
If this piece of dress isn't from Elizabeth's...  Then it's...
I don't have any gray silk dresses, Louis. Neither does my sister since we wear the same clothes.
Yeah...  that's exactly what I wanted to check with you...
I'm so sorry, Louis.
Thank you...
Are you alright?
You know, I'm sure there's a good reason why your mother was at the scene.
Thank you, Emily.
The dagger was held by the hand of a woman.
We found the murder weapon.
What is it?
A dagger. Quite slim.
Have you found its owner?
Not yet, still searching, as it happens. That said, since the blade penetrated the body several times, the murderer's hand will have been covered in blood.
Hmm, you think that's a clue?
The handprint was a very slender hand, Emily. Probably that of a woman.
Do you realize what that means? There are only three of us on the island.
Bearing in mind that neither my sister nor myself had any reason to set upon the young lady... that means...
I know, Emily...  I know...
Keep up your courage, Louis...  I'm sure there's an explanation.. you're bound to shed some light on it all.
If what you say is true, Emily, I am less and less enthusiastic about shedding any light on the subject...
… Return
Leave
I won't keep you, Emily. Thank you for answering my questions.
See you, Louis.
What can I do for you, Louis?
I've come to see you about last night's tragedy.

I won't keep you, Emily. Thank you for answering my questions.
See you, Louis.
Alright? Have you finished?
Not quite. I'd like you to answer a few questions.
Did you kill Elizabeth Adams?
Let's get right to it. Are you Elizabeth Adams' murderer?
That is for you to prove, if I'm not mistaken, boy.
You weren't expecting me to do all the legwork for you, were you? Lazy man.
I found his footprint at the scene.
I know you were at the scene.
We will save a lot of time if you just tell me what happened.
You know nothing at all!
Enlighten me, then. For now, I have your footprint in a pool of blood.
That's right. The only thing you can prove is one of my boots was at the scene.
Congratulations, you've wrapped up the investigation.
Do you enjoy hitting women?
Two days ago, I surprised you having a go at Miss Adams.
What happened? Did you want to give her another beating? She wouldn't let you push her around again?
Shut up, you little shit! You have no idea what happened and here you are carping away... 
You think you're investigator of the year...  Have you taken a look at yourself, de Richet?
Didn't you get enough, beating her black and blue the last time?
I did not... 
Don't let him off!
Why?
Nothing! Get away from me!
Just as soon as you stop treating me like I'm an idiot!
If you wanted people to think you were guilty, you couldn't have done any better!
So cut the bullshit and come clean, now!
I can't! He'll come for revenge.
Who?
No one! Just shut you trap, goddammit!
Yes, I was there! Yes, I walked in her blood!
You've got all you need to wrap it up, now scram!
Continue... 
Go on, keep going... 
Finish what you came to do, then get out of my room!
Has he still got his gun?
You were armed the night of my arrival. Can I see your weapon?
No.
You do realize you're not helping, don't you!? You're making it worse for yourself.
I found his letter, let's talk about it
I'd like to talk about the letter you're writing, what woman is it addressed to?
Who says it's a woman?
I'm not saying any more, there's no point you insisting.
I've finished
Goodbye, sir. We shall meet again.
Probably.
What do you want from me, de Richet?
Greetings, It's fallen to me that... 
Cut the crap. Get to the point, we both know why you're here.
And have you got anything to tell me?
What does it matter? It's too late anyway. Do what you have to do and get out... 
He doesn't look well.
It's never too late, sir. If you have something to say, now is the time.
You don't understand. Everything's already written. It's over.
Why is he behaving like the perfect culprit?
What is it that's already written? I'm not sure I follow you.
No, you don't... 
Search the room

Greetings, Louis.
Mr President. You can guess why I'm here.
Of course... 
Lord Mortimer has sent me to ask you a few questions about last night.
It's...  How am I going to tell Elizabeth's father that she is dead?
I know, Mr President. I shall endeavor to find out the truth about this tragedy. I must ask you to help me though, please.
Find the degenerate pig who did this, Louis.
He looks like he's grieving.
Are you alright, Mr President? Are you feeling alright?
Oh, don't worry. It's this rotten toothache.
What do you expect, I'm no spring chicken now.
Had he spoken to her?
Tell me, Mr President, had you spoken to Elizabeth since your arrival?
You know her father, you thought she was dead... 
No, I didn't. And I believe I'll be taking my remorse with me to my grave.
I wanted to but I didn't know where to begin... 
You can't blame yourself, you...  you couldn't have known that her days were numbered.
What is his alibi for last night?
I'm talking to all the guests to find out who has an alibi, and, well, who doesn't, Mr President.
Can you tell me what you were doing last night so that I can strike your name off the list?
I spent the night right here reading.
All night?
Exactly. Emily stopped by in the middle of the night, you can ask her. She wanted to talk about some business we have in common.
That corroborates Emily's version.
Anything whatsoever to do with Elizabeth?
Not at all, Louis. A business matter.
Ask him about the laudanum
Were you aware that Elizabeth took laudanum?
Yes, she came to ask me for some. She had finished her reserve, I believe.
Did he know why?
Did she tell your why she was so desperate to get some, Mr President?
She said she had terrible migraines that wouldn't go away.
More likely for the voices she heard, not the migraines.
Does he take a lot?
Do you take it regularly, Mr President?
Unfortunately, I do, Louis. I still suffer from a terrible toothache and it's not likely to get any better.
It's just for that then?
Old age, my young friend. I don't wish it upon you but you'll soon see. At my age, it's rare to have no problems in that domain.
And do you take a lot?
A moderate amount, Louis. Only the dosage indicated on the prescription of my doctor.
Anything else?... 
Do you know if she had any enemies?
Do you know if she had any enemies, Mr President?
Not that I know of.
I heard about her altercation with Mr Péru but that case was closed, if I'm not mistaken.
But if in doubt, I wouldn't leave any door unopened and I'd go and question your fellow countryman.
Don't worry. Countryman or not, I'm not letting anybody slip through the cracks.
Does he know why she was here?
Do you know why she came to the island?
To get help, if I'm not mistaken. Isn't that right?
Indeed. Sir Gregory suggested to her father, that he introduce her to Lord Mortimer, to see if he could help her.
Why invite her now then?
It would appear that she wasn't invited to the conference.
That doesn't surprise me. The poor girl was in no way concerned by our business and she had no political clout.
So I don't understand why Sir Gregory invited her during the conference of his good friend Lord Mortimer.
He must have realized that he wouldn't have much time to grant her. Preparing a conference does not seem an easy task.
On the evening of our arrival, Lord Mortimer didn't even welcome us, what with his being so busy and all.
Yes, you are right, Louis. I didn't think of that.
It is indeed rather surprising. The easiest thing to do is simply ask him, you know.
Of course... 
Let him finish
Yes, Lord Mortimer has a talent for healing, apparently.
I'm not surprised Sir Gregory advised her to come.
Agreed... 
Speak to him about the footprint.
Mr President, we found a footprint at the scene of the crime.
Not a dress shoe, I hope. That's all I wear.
No, rest assured, it looks like the print of a big ankle boot. Large size, I'd say.
Perfect, that should help you, Louis. It's a clue.
Return... 
Leave
I shan't keep you any longer, Mr President.
Feel free, Louis. If there's anything I can do, just ask.
Thank you, Mr President.
Greetings, Louis.

Find the degenerate pig who did this, Louis.
He looks like he's grieving.
Are you alright, Mr President? Are you feeling alright?
Oh, don't worry. It's this rotten toothache.
What do you expect, I'm no spring chicken now.
Had he spoken to her?
Tell me, Mr President, had you spoken to Elizabeth since your arrival?
You know her father, you thought she was dead... 
No, I didn't. And I believe I'll be taking my remorse with me to my grave.
I wanted to but I didn't know where to begin... 
You can't blame yourself, you...  you couldn't have known that her days were numbered.
What is his alibi for last night?
I'm talking to all the guests to find out who has an alibi, and, well, who doesn't, Mr President.
Can you tell me what you were doing last night so that I can strike your name off the list?
I spent the night right here reading.
All night?
Exactly. Emily stopped by in the middle of the night, you can ask her. She wanted to talk about some business we have in common.
That corroborates Emily's version.
Anything whatsoever to do with Elizabeth?
Not at all, Louis. A business matter.
Ask him about the laudanum
Were you aware that Elizabeth took laudanum?
Yes, she came to ask me for some. She had finished her reserve, I believe.
Did he know why?
Did she tell your why she was so desperate to get some, Mr President?
She said she had terrible migraines that wouldn't go away.
More likely for the voices she heard, not the migraines.
Does he take a lot?
Do you take it regularly, Mr President?
Unfortunately, I do, Louis. I still suffer from a terrible toothache and it's not likely to get any better.
It's just for that then?
Old age, my young friend. I don't wish it upon you but you'll soon see. At my age, it's rare to have no problems in that domain.
And do you take a lot?
A moderate amount, Louis. Only the dosage indicated on the prescription of my doctor.
Anything else?... 
Do you know if she had any enemies?
Do you know if she had any enemies, Mr President?
Not that I know of.
I heard about her altercation with Mr Péru but that case was closed, if I'm not mistaken.
But if in doubt, I wouldn't leave any door unopened and I'd go and question your fellow countryman.
Don't worry. Countryman or not, I'm not letting anybody slip through the cracks.
Does he know why she was here?
Do you know why she came to the island?
To get help, if I'm not mistaken. Isn't that right?
Indeed. Sir Gregory suggested to her father, that he introduce her to Lord Mortimer, to see if he could help her.
Why invite her now then?
It would appear that she wasn't invited to the conference.
That doesn't surprise me. The poor girl was in no way concerned by our business and she had no political clout.
So I don't understand why Sir Gregory invited her during the conference of his good friend Lord Mortimer.
He must have realized that he wouldn't have much time to grant her. Preparing a conference does not seem an easy task.
On the evening of our arrival, Lord Mortimer didn't even welcome us, what with his being so busy and all.
Yes, you are right, Louis. I didn't think of that.
It is indeed rather surprising. The easiest thing to do is simply ask him, you know.
Of course... 
Let him finish
Yes, Lord Mortimer has a talent for healing, apparently.
I'm not surprised Sir Gregory advised her to come.
Agreed... 
Speak to him about the footprint.
Mr President, we found a footprint at the scene of the crime.
Not a dress shoe, I hope. That's all I wear.
No, rest assured, it looks like the print of a big ankle boot. Large size, I'd say.
Perfect, that should help you, Louis. It's a clue.
Return... 
Leave
I shan't keep you any longer, Mr President.
Feel free, Louis. If there's anything I can do, just ask.
Thank you, Mr President.
Examine the arm
There are numerous marks on the body. She must have fought like a lion.
It couldn't have happened without a lot of noise.
There are also a number of old scars.
Examine the scars
Scarring, ugh...  Scarring isn't very regular but they are mostly from old cuts.
Analyze the scars
The scars are superficial and were made several years ago. She wasn't trying to take her own life.
Meaning of scarring.
People who scar themselves in this way generally do so to relieve some kind of psychological suffering.
By trying to master the pain, they establish their self-control.
Examine the tattoos.
The Sigilum Dei Aemaeth
She had the Sigilum Dei Aemaeth tattooed on her. The symbol of the living God.
Written in the language of angels according to believers.
It is rare for someone to know about symbols like this at her age. Unless her mother was a tutor.
Observe the tattoos
The symbol of the Masons. What's that doing here?
Translate the texts
Ancient Greek...  Let's see what it means.
These are sacred chants intended to protect their bearer.
But from whom? Or from what?
… Return to the arm
… Return to the body
Examine the upper body
I count no fewer than...  9 wounds on the thorax, with a lot of blood. On first sight, I'd say that's what caused her death.
Examine the wounds
The wounds are clean and look like they've been inflicted by a sharp object.
Some of the lacerations have damaged vital organs: the heart...  the right lung which is perforated.
Most of them weren't given with much force. She might even have survived.
But the stab in the heart, though not all that deep, sealed her fate.
Observe the wounds
It looks as though the wounds were inflicted from a precise angle.
As if... 
As if the murderer was standing behind Elizabeth.
Examine the tattoos.
Some of these tattoos are veritable works of... 
What's that...  The skin between her breasts is different...  Bloody hell!
This tattoo was drawn on a page of leather and stitched onto her skin, probably during childhood, if the scars are anything to go by.
It's the same kind of tattoo as on the rest of her body.
… Return to the body
Examine the head
I see no sign of bruising on the skull... 
The only clue is the scar from a previous craniectomy.
Poor Elizabeth: she...  she must have been very young when she went through all that...  That's torture!
She also has old scars around the neck. Maybe mutilations.
Examine her nose
She bled from the nose.
Observe the nose.
There are signs of bleeding but I don't see any traces of bruising.
Observe the bleed.
... Return to the head
Examine her mouth
*sniff* What a strange smell... 
A smell common at the court of the King.
Laudanum. Certain courtiers use it to get drunk.
If taken in large quantities it can provoke fits of madness.
I know that smell.
Her breath smells of alcohol and of laudanum. People use it to relieve pain.
... Return to the head
... Return to the body
Examine the hands
No wounds, but blood on the right hand, nothing on the left except that tattooed symbol... 
Examine the symbol.
This pentacle is a trap.
The wearers of the pentacle thought that they were protected from evil by surrounding it inside the different circles of the pentacle.
Observe the wrists
No marks or bruising around the wrists. It doesn't look like she was tied up or held by force.
... Return to the body
Examine the legs
Blood, but no trace of blows on the legs.
Look at the tattoos.
More tattoos, similar to those on the rest of her body.
Analyze the blood streaks
The direction of the blood streaks caused by the wounds to the thorax show that she was standing when she lost blood.
This proves that she was standing when she was assassinated. Possibly held by someone or something.
Sexual assault
Let's see... 
No trace of sexual assault or rape.
... Return to the body

At last we meet, Monsieur de Richet.
Do you mind if I call you Louis?
Please do.
Thank you.
I wish to apologize wholeheartedly, Louis.
I made you cross the seas and I wasn't even here to welcome you.
When I asked you to join us here, it was, of course, in the hope that you would help us find your mother.
Unfortunately I am now confronted with another problem, which I would rather have done without:
You see, last night Miss Adams also went missing... 
She hasn't disappeared.
I understand your concern, my Lord, but I don't think these things are as bad as they seem.
I'd like to know more.
And why is that? Can you tell me more?
Let him speak.
... 
I have had my people searching for her all over the island, alas to no avail.
It so happens that both her mental and her physical health are extremely fragile. I'm worried that the same thing happened to her as to your mother.
Also, I would appreciate it...  very much...  if you could tell me what you were doing on the floor, in her room, in the early hours of the morning.
It's quite normal. I...  I can explain everything.
Oh, haha. Well, I'm glad to hear it.
You see, Sir Gregory is about to arrive and he has taken Elizabeth's disappearance very, very seriously.
Please, reassure him so that we can talk about your mother.
However, there may be some new developments, but I...  I don't know if they are linked to your mother... 
We have found Elizabeth Adams' body in her room.
I'm afraid she was brutally murdered, stabbed several times.
I...  but... 
Who did it?
Who...  who could have done it?
That is precisely what I would like you to help us find out.
I only bumped into her last night.
I can't believe it. We bumped into each other last night on our way to bed.
Yes, I know.
Say nothing
... 
Duchess Hillsborrow informed us that she accompanied you at the beginning of the evening.
You apparently bumped into Miss Adams who wanted to speak to you.
We are told you turned her away and she went away on her own... 
That's correct.
Do you know what she wanted to see you about by any chance?
Unfortunately not.
Not in the least.
She seemed confused.
She seemed upset about something. I thought she was under the influence of alcohol. But we didn't really speak.
Pity, the poor child was probably trying to find help.
I thought it could wait until tomorrow... 
Hmm, apparently not.
But an act of horrific violence occurred during the night.
And I do not know if this is linked to the disapearance of Sarah... 
What do you mean?
What are you getting at? What act of violence?
We...  we found Elizabeth Adams' body in her room.
She was brutally mudered, stabbed several times.
A link with my mother?
If there is a possible link to my mother, I...  I hope you'll let me know.
In the early hours of the morning, Elizabeth Adams was found dead in her room, savagely mutilated with a knife.
What?...  But...  I...  How is it possible?
That's precisely what I want to find out.
I'll get straight to the point, Louis, according to the initial elements at my disposal, you were the last person to see her alive.
Yes, last night we...  Do you suspect me?
I want you to tell me everything that happened last night, and leave nothing out.
Tell me, how did the evening begin?
I was with Duchess Hillsborrow
Duchess Hillsborrow and I were returning to our rooms when Elizabeth came up to us.
She was in a state of panic and insisted that she needed to speak to me. She said she feared for her life.
I took my leave of the Duchess and followed Elizabeth to her room.
I was going to bed.
I was going up to my room when I saw Elizabeth waiting for me... 
She was very upset, and her words didn't make sense.
I thought it best to follow her to her room, as she had asked me to.
Hmhm, continue... 
She insisted we have a drink, without which she refused to confide anything.
What exactly did she want to speak about?
About her childhood with my mother.
About my mother...  She had just found out that I was Sarah de Richet's son.
Elizabeth wanted to tell me about the horrors my mother apparently inflicted on her.
Finding out that your own parents had always lied to you... 
Well, that must not have been an easy thing to hear.
She thought she'd seen my mother.
She claimed she saw my mother the previous evening, on the cliff, if I remember correctly... 
Interesting. I will send someone as soon as possible... 
But do go on... 
I refused to go on drinking with her.
She already seemed drunk and her conversation became confused.
So then she ordered me to get out.
If only I had stayed... 
Don't blame yourself, Louis, how you could you have known?
But thank you for this new information.
Is there nothing you want to say, Louis?
... 
It wasn't me, I...  I didn't kill her.
I'd much rather have met you under different circumstances.
Lord Mortimer, believe me, I am very conscious of the gravity of the situation.
... 
Everything seems to point to me as the one who killed Elizabeth, but I swear I am innocent.
Out of repsect for your mother, rest assured that I do want to believe you.
And all I want is to be able to prove it to you.
When do we start?
We already have.
Tell me, Louis...  how do you feel?
Silly question.
My Lord, don't take this the wrong way but what do you mean by a question like that?
You find me unconscious in front of Miss Adams' body, and you ask me how I feel?
I am very serious, Louis. I'm concerned for you.
Slightly...  lost
I feel a bit disoriented... 
Hmhm, that's only normal in your situation.
You can hardly say you've been left unscathed lately.
First, the disappearance of your mother. And now this murder.
Trapped like a rat.
I feel like I'm a rat trapped in a maze... 
Interesting.
I beg your pardon?
Sarah also felt like she was trapped, like an animal.
Where are you going with this, my Lord?
Sarah's behavior grew odd before her disappearance.
Her attitude changed, she became prey to outbursts of violence and a number of temporary absences.
I'm just trying to make sure that you don't go getting lost like your mother did.
You're not suggesting that I might have killed Elizabeth and that I don't remember, are you?
I don't know, Louis. It's just that what with your mother, and now you, it's rather a lot... 
The more I take stock of the situation, the more I'm under the impression that you've been set up.
But before going any further, I must inform you that Sir Gregory is about to arrive.
He is coming to question you about the murder of poor Elizabeth, whom he was very fond of.
He is quite determined to find the culprit, whomever they may be.
So convince him of your innocence, then we can continue this conversation.
Enclosed are the witness statements of guests Bonaparte and Hillsborrow.
Statement of Napoleon Bonaparte:
When asked, "What were you doing yesterday evening?", Monsieur Bonaparte replied:
"After talking with Lord Mortimer, I spent the evening playing cards with Sir Gregory, Mr Washington and his Eminence Piaggi.
Sir Gregory won".
When asked, "Did you notice anything strange throughout the evening?", Monsieur Bonaparte replied:
"At daybreak, I thought I saw someone on the balcony but couldn't see who it was"
Statement of Duchess Hillsborrow:
When asked, "What were you doing yesterday evening?", the Duchess replied:
“I spent the evening in Monsieur de Richet's company. We admired the works exhibited in the Manor Gallery.
While going up to bed, we ran into Miss Adams.
As I was tired, I left Monsieur de Richet and Miss Adams in conversation and went to bed."
When asked, "Did you notice anything strange throughout the evening?", the Duchess replied:
"No, not that I remember."

There are fragments of burnt papers in the chimney.
There is a legible fragment left, Hey, I recognize my mother's handwriting.
She says : "We must find a safer way to communicate: someone is onto us. Trust in my faith in the man with the sword."
So Mother had an accomplice here...  who could it be?
Who could she be suspicious of?
I must find the next part... Faith, a man with a sword, I recognize her love of riddles there!

“I must go beyond the Nightmare”... 
What does she mean by that?
It's probably allegorical
I'm guessing it's a metaphor.
I need to figure out what this means.
Mortimer is getting his guests together, I ought to join them so I don't look suspicious.
It's probably literal
Clearly, she must be trying to do something useful but… but what?
The Nightmare...  does that remind me of anything?
It's an object
It probably has to do with an object or something... 
It's a place
It must surely speak of a place.
It's a concept
Well, if it's a concept, I've got no idea what it is…
Granting that this is the case, where might it be found?
A ground floor room
A first floor room
A second floor room
Outside the manor
Try to remember
... was a study, I'm practically sure of it.

Observe the painting
It's Saint John, painted by Guido Reni.
Scrutinize the frame
The painting looks like it's been taken down recently.
What was it my mother said? That she would wait for an answer, hidden behind the apostle.
Ah, of course! There's something written behind the painting!
“On the second day, the pilgrims will listen to the prophecy of the young apostle.”
“They shall add one companion to their left and three to their right to complete their rank.”
... what does it mean?
What do I know about this apostle?
That's right, Saint John is often credited with writing about the Apocalypse in the last book of the Bible.
He's also known as the youngest of Christ's apostles.
Saint John is known as the youngest of Christ's apostles.
We often give credit to Saint John for having written about the Apocalypse, in the last book of the Bible.

Saint John is the only apostle painted in this gallery who hasn't got a beard.
Think about the code
Think about the figures
“They should add a companion to their left and three to their right to complete their ranks.”
I imagine it applies to their code? The one Mother set up with the pilgrims?
What's this? A group of pilgrims who Paul was talking to...  and now John is telling them prophecies?
Remember the aforementioned Book
“On the second day, the pilgrims listened to the prophecy of the young apostle.”
The prophecy of the young apostle...  that was John. And the prophecy mentioned, is most likely the Book of Revelations according to Saint John.
Go back
Leave
Hey, wait! That means it's him, he's the youngest apostle!
Right, this painting is therefore associated with the answer which “E” had to give to my mother.
Now I just need to know how to recover the answer...

It's a sentence in Hebrew.

It says "Count in the dust".
Alright. Let's do it.
Why in Hebrew?
Choosing the Hebrew alphabet is no coincidence. It's...  it's got to be a reference to the Bible.

Inspect the dusty piece of furniture.
There are finger marks, deliberately drawn in the dust...  8 in all.
That's what the message in Hebrew spoke about! Hebrew, 8.
Examine the candlestick
No...  nothing of value here.
Behind the painting
It's too cumbersome for me to unhook here, but judging by the dust, it hasn't been moved for months, if not years!
Move away

Observe the painting
Painting of Saint Mark, from the collection of the apostles by Guido Reni.
Look at the frame
There's nothing worth noticing here.
Inspect the surroundings.
Scrutinize the chest of drawers.
Little characters are engraved on the chest of drawers, under the urn.
It's a sentence in Hebrew.
I know what that means.
It says "Count in the dust".
Alright. Let's do it.

Observe the painting
A drawing of the apostle Mathew, painted by Guido Reni.
He's represented as writing the Word of the Lord, transmitted by the Holy Spirit...  who appears here in the guise of an angel.
Look at the frame
There's something else behind this painting...
It says: "Half of each group will join the first city of Corinth."
What the hell does that mean?
Think about the town quoted.
It must be the group of pilgrims mentioned from before. I guess maybe the city of Corinth is a reference to the Epistle from Corinthians in the Bible.
Think about the group of pilgrims
The group of pilgrims...  if I'm not mistaken, numbered respectively 12 and 14 in the last painting.
With the simple operation suggested, that would mean that the new groups are 6 and 7.

Saint Paul, painted by Guido Reni
Inspect the painting
Saint Paul is shown holding a sword.
Strange, there's hardly any dust, as if the painting's been cleaned recently... 
There's a small inscription engraved on the frame.
Let's take a closer look...  “This is how Paul spoke to his pilgrims from Rome.”
Just above that, someone's written down the figure 11 on the painting, and underlined it twice!
I don't know what does that mean?
Two faces of the same saint?
Strange, Saint Paul is shown twice, unlike the other disciples.
He is not an evangelist.
Of the 4 apostles shown in this piece, Paul is the only one who isn't an evangelist. He is the thirteenth apostle.
Think about the secret code
So we have...  the figure 11, twice underlined.
And a story of a group of pilgrims, who it looks like Paul is speaking to.
Maybe it's a code, there must be a connexion. A text on Paul must be somewhere, and it must be associated with the figure 11.
But what's the story with these pilgrims? I mean...  A connection with the figure maybe?
Sum up the information from the painting

Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, by Caravaggio.
Examine the painting
Caravaggio attained a magnificent command of black, and the play of colors too.
Paul facing an ordeal. The curtain of his illusions is being raised, and he receives the light from his savior.
I remember this story.
A fierce opponent of the first Christians, Saint Paul is suddenly struck by the call of Jesus Christ, and converts.
It's the best known conversion in Christian history, which teaches us that even enemies of Christ can be saved.
And even become his greatest apostles after finding Faith.
From what I can recall, the account of his conversion can be found in the Epistles to the Galatians, the Philippians, the Corinthians and the Acts of the Apostles.
Two representations of the same saint... 
Saint Paul is the only saint to be presented twice in these paintings, contrary to the other apostles.
How come?
The myth of Saint Paul is well known.
Examine the frame.
This painting has been hanging here for a long time, a lot of dust has built up on it.
A finger has drawn a number in the thin layer of dust.
I can read the number...  4.

Please, sit back down, Louis.
This sort of behaviour is not working in your favour, young man.
Good evening, Monsieur de Richet.
Likewise, Sir Gregory... 
Well then, let us begin...
