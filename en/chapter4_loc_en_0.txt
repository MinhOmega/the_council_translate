Nail
One of the nails used to open the Crypt door. 
Am I disturbing you?
Well, well!  Monsieur de Richet, back on your feet at last...
I'm so pleased...
Thank you for your concern...
And of course, not a word about my wound...
Lord Mortimer spoke most highly of you...
Have you thought about your vote? I mean, is your choice truly final?
Well, technically, I still haven't made a choice yet.
They seem to think I'm on Mortimer's side...
The fact is I haven't committed myself to anyone for the moment.
Splendid! That will certainly please Sir Gregory!
Ah, de Richet...
Nice try with George Washington...
You are still a bit raw to be trying to manipulate an old wolf like him, so what could be expected? Do not blame yourself.
Ah, de Richet, congratulations on your efforts with Washington...
I see that Sir Gregory was right to trust you.
Thank you.
Nothing about my hand! Totally blind!
Come on, get moving, Louis.
Monsieur de Richet! I have found this conference at times quite amusing...
Please forgive that rather public humiliation, but I think you've learned your lesson...
No hard feelings?
You... if I hadn't planned to be gone within the hour, I would gladly return the favor!
And of course, not a word about my wound...
Those are the risks of the profession, you can't win them all.
Goddammit, de Richet!
Are you joking or what? You sell me pipe dreams about Mortimer's project and a few hours later, one of your allies completely breaks down.
Is this what Mortimer's side is all about?
Listen, I'm kind of in a rush.
Enough is enough. Choose your side, and then everyone will be happy.
What??
What are you playing at, de Richet?
It's too late! I've come too far to back out now!
Good God, I swear there's nothing common about you, de Richet!
So everyone tells me.
Monsieur de Richet, it seems you are everywhere...
Duke Manuel...
Shit! Just my luck!
At least he hasn't noticed my arm...
Was Monsieur von Wöllner able to help you?
Help me?
Yes, for your armillary sphere...?
Oh yes, that!
Louis? Everything alright?
I... Yes, yes... Excuse me, I w... I was miles away...
Oh, while you're here, you wouldn't know who the last guest is, would you?
What do you mean?
I heard Sir Gregory speaking about it.
A certain... Al Azif something or other.
Who? Wh... I...
Obviously not.
It's not important, forget it...
No, no, no, hang on...
It doesn't matter, I'm telling you, we'll find out soon enough.
I'm in a hurry right now, I... I'm waiting for someone.
See you later, Louis.
Shit, I haven't time either...
See you later.
Ask about Al Azif
Is Al Azif to participate in the conference?
That's what I was asking you...
MIND READ
As von Wöllner mentioned the arrival of this person just before the second conference...
Go back
Ask for more info
Do you know who it is?
No... No, I thought so for a minute, but the name means nothing to me...
Sorry.
It doesn't matter. Something tells me we shall find out soon enough, no?
Certainly...
Leave
Well, I must be leaving you.
Duke Manuel...
Monsieur Bonaparte stood me up!
Would you believe it?
Ah, the French!...
So tell me, what can I do for you?
Ask about Al Azif
Earlier, you mentioned the arrival of a certain Al Achif and...
No, no, Al Azif!
I spoke to you about a certain Al Azif!
Oh sorry, I got mixed up. Al Azif, then.
MIND READER
Al Azif, it's not really all that difficult to remember.
I wonder what role he is to have in all of this...
It should not be long before we find out, according to Sir Gregory, he will be arriving just before the conference starts.
Leave
I'm sorry to have troubled you. I'll be leaving now.
Perfect, I was going up to my room anyway.
See you later.
So, Holm has planned something to do with the Al Azif just before the next conference.
Leave
My mistake, excuse me, I don't want to trouble you any further.
I'll be going.
See you later.
