Who do you think you are?
Forgive me sir!
If we were in France, I'd just sent you to the guillotine for what you just said!
Please, just let me go back to my room!
Hey, you! Stay out of it! This is none of your business...
I'm gonna teach this little slut how to behave.
What the hell is this all about?
I don't think you know who I am.
Stop! I beg you! I... I didn't mean to...  ! Don't hit me …  ! Please sir!
Shit, if I step in, Adams might just run back to her room...
And if I do nothing, yes Washington will have enough time to search, but this girl's gonna suffer.
Damnit, what should I do?
Let it go
You filthy whore!
I apologize, have mercy... Please have mercy!
I apologize nyah, nyah, nyah... mercy, have mercy... nyah, nyah, nyah
Where is that smart mouth now? I'll teach you a little respect.
Insult him
Look, you dumb ass, are you deaf? She said she was sorry!
Call me that again!
Insult again
Leave her alone!
Are you looking for a slap, sonny?
Attack him
Punch him hard
Leave me alone!
Washington must have finished by now...
Do nothing (HIDDEN)
Avoid the conflict
...
Keep quiet
...
... that's what I thought. Now, get out. I have to deal with this dirty slut.
Yes, you just remind him where he is
Are you out of your mind? What about the consequences?
What are you talking about?
The consequences of beating up one of Lord Mortimer's friends, in his own house.
You tell him about that and you'll have to answer to me.
Do not make the situation worse
My mother told me often enough: Sometimes the end does justify the means.
I had hoped I wouldn't have to apply that rule but... at least Washington will have enough time.
Console Elizabeth
It's too late for that...
Look, uh... Please... exc …  
Leave me alone!
Calm Elizabeth
I'm sorry but my intervention would have only made things worse.
Look, we all have bad days, but hopefully tomorrow will be better.
Can I call a servant to attend to you or...
I... no... I just want to return to my room...  
Apologize
Forgive me... he took me by surprise, I... I didn't think he'd really hit you.
Please, don't touch me...
Do nothing
Given the mess, talking's not gonna help anything...
Let her take care of herself
From the looks of her, it wouldn't surprise me if she insulted his mother.
Well, at least, Washington can take his time.
Step in and risk Adams getting away
Let her go!
Stay out of it, boy!
Shit!
What are you playing at?
I told you to mind your own business, boy!
If you think you can side with this whore and then just walk away, you're out of your mind!
Give me one good reason not to knock you down!
Hit him
That's the spirit, but it won't be enough.
Intimidate him
Ha! Sir, you obviously do not know who I am or you'd keep your distance.
Ooh one more like that and I'm gonna get scared !
Calm him down
Listen, we can sort this out like gentlemen...
No, I don't think so.
You haven't hurt anyone yet, my friend...
No but I'm about to...
Remind him where he is
You're not back in your slum now, you're in Lord Mortimer's home! I suggest you think carefully about what you're going to do...
Don't think you're getting away with it that easily!
I'm sick of all these toffs! If we were in Paris, I'd send you all to the guillotine!
And on top of it all, a woman telling me how I ought to behave! I won't stand for it!
Hum ok ok... just wait a minute...  
What? Don't tell me you're going to defend these harlots!?
Play along with him
Ah, women, right?... They really do drive us crazy sometimes, I totally understand.
Yeah, and everytime they open their mouths they make you want to slap'em.
Let's calm things down.
Hold on, let's take a second and think about this. We're not animals, so let's not act like one..
I knew you were a pantywaist!
You make me wanna puke.
Okay, you really are an animal.
Keep quiet
...
Cat got your tongue?
There's nothing better than a wise word.
I believe in man. From speech comes dialogue, from dialogue peace is born. And from peace, great destinies flourish.
... the fuck are you talking about?
I get the feeling you're trying to put one over on me! If that's the case you're making a big mistake...
Sorry about that. Look, there's no point in us aggravating each other. Let's both just go our separate ways.
Don't move, we're not done yet! You wanted to be the knight in shining armor and save the damsel in distress...
Let's see how brave you are.
Remain dignified
Aim well, you'll only get one shot.
At this distance, even a blind man couldn't miss.
If you miss, you're a dead man, sir.
He must have a weak spot...
I've watched you and you're shaking. I'm betting you won't fire...
Beg for mercy
Listen, we barely know each other, and it seems everything went a bit too far.
Let me apologize if I offended you in any way.
What's wrong? Someone cut your balls off?
Make him doubt
Think about it, you know your head will roll tomorrow if you shoot.
Wanna bet?
Sure do.
Good Outcome
I'm not in the habit of beating Lord Mortimer's guests in his own salon.
You got off easy this time, but don't try it again.
Bad outcome
You should have kept your big nose out!
Who do you think you are?
Forgive me sir!
If we were in France, I'd just sent you to the guillotine for what you just said!
Please, just let me go back to my room!
Hey, you! Stay out of it! This is none of your business...

Tell me, my good man.
Yes Sir?
Does he know where the small salon is?
Would you know, by any chance, where the small salon is?
Of course, sir. Go down the stairs to the Great Hall.
Once downstairs, take the door on your right.
Thank you.
Is there anything else you need?
What is he doing here?
Why are you standing in front of this door?
I have been instructed to let no one enter.
I'm wasting my time here. Lady Adams could return to her room at any minute. What a shame, I wonder what's going on inside.
Will there be anything else, sir?
Drop it Louis, there's no time to lose.

Come on Louis, concentrate.

It's a letter from Lady Hillsborrow that she apparently never got to send.
Office 101, Buckingham Palace, London.
"Dear Mr Walsingham, nothing to worry about."
"I cannot meet you at the palace as planned as an important matter has cropped up which requires all my attention.
"You will guess who I have gone to fetch at dear Mortimer's, and thus you will understand my hurried departure."
What on earth is she talking about?
"I can guarantee we'll be back as soon as possible."
"You will understand that to be able to serve you, I must assemble all my assets."
"You know I put the interests of the Crown above my own."
"Tell the Queen I of course will assume all of the responsibility and consequences for my absence."
"Your devoted servant, E.H."
Wow. This looks serious.
Walsingham. Name rings a bell.
Walsingham... where have I heard that name before?
Ah, yes. That's right!! It's the name of a famous master spy for Queen Elizabeth I.
Seeing that the fellow has been dead for the past two hundred years, it must be an alias.
No doubt, Emily is involved in the secret dealings of the Crown.
What's Emily's line of work?
It would seem that our dear Emily is in the service of the British Crown.
Now I'm not saying she's definitely involved in shady deals, but I'll bet she does do some top secret stuff. Sneaky little minx.
I wonder who this Walsingham is?
Put down the letter
Well, at any rate, Emily didn't come here to finish up a deal with anyone. She came here looking for someone, just like I did.

This doesn't seem to be the room from my vision...
This doesn't seem to be the room from my vision...
Don't move!
Emily?
Louis?
I can explain!
Perhaps, but remain still.
But... but first... you could perhaps...  remove the blade from my throat...  
You have ten seconds to explain your presence here
Swear your innocence.
I'm didn't come here for you.
Swear his innocence.
Appearances can be misleading, I'm... I'm only passing through.
And the origami bird, I suppose it simply flew into your pocket?
Actually, I was just putting it back!
Don't push your luck.
Apologize politely
Madame, ten seconds isn't enough for me to tell you how sorry I really am for having entered your room. And I mean that sincerely.
That's a good start.
Try to calm her down.
Emily! We both know you're not going to kill anyone this evening.
Be careful... I might have to cut you off.
Wait! Hah, let's talk about this misunderstanding.
Keep quiet.
...
... if you value your life, I suggest you start talking.
What are you doing in my room?
Spin the truth.
Right. I found myself trapped on the balcony and your room was the only one open. I'm sorry.
My window was closed!
But not locked.
All the same, I wasn't going to sleep outside!
If you had knocked, I would have opened.
I... I did not wish to wake you.
Oh please. You're just making things worse for yourself.
Reassure her.
First of all, let's keep calm. My being here is just a coincidence.
Anyway, I seriously doubt what I'm doing in your room is really the question that interests you, now is it?
Clever boy. So answer the question that does interest me.
Appearances are deceptive.
I... I thought a night stroll would help me sleep better. A servant must have closed the window behind me and …  
... and my window is the only way for you to get back inside … most convincing!
Appearances are deceptive.
I was only passing through, I SWEAR IT to you.
I was in a hurry, I... I didn't know whose room I was ent...  entering, look …  
For someone in a hurry, you still found time to ogle me naked on my bed...
...
Oh yes. The first time you came through I was awake.
It was dark and I... I didn't realise it was you, I... I had to look closely.
Shut your mouth, sir!! You are only making it worse for yourself!
Keep quiet.
...
Louis, your childish games are trying my patience...
There's not much more I can say, really.
Are you trying to make me angry?
What were you really doing on the balcony?
Mention the conversation of the vision.
Going outside was the only way I could listen to what was being said in the room next door.
If you knew the trouble I went through to get to the balcony...
That reminds me of a story. Last time I was in Madrid I had to climb up a church and there were...
Louis, your little anecdote is quite fascinating, but please stop wasting my time.
Speak about the young soldier of the vision.
A young soldier arrived this evening.
Someone was waiting for him in his room.
I wanted to find out more and... what I heard... was worth the risk.
All right, go on.
Worry about her.
Seeing the window open, I feared someone had entered your room.
With what I'd heard next door, I had every reason to believe that your life was in danger.
I am a grown woman, but how kind of you to worry about me.
Now that I'm safe and sound, tell me more.
Worry about her.
I... I heard someone enter your room. I feared for your safety!
Do you mock me sir?! You admitted you were ogling my backside only seconds ago!
Oh shit!
You're a terrible liar Louis.
I... I admit it... I looked upon you but... I really did hear an alarming conversation!
Keep quiet.
...
I see. You don't want to reveal your secrets.
Keep quiet..
...
Louis, if I wanted your silence, I would have slit your vocal cords, now answer me!
Has this anything to do with the Order?
...
Oh yes. Washington informed me you were part of the Order.
You too? You're part of this too?
Yes. Now answer.
Do these events concern me? Do they involve the Golden Order?
Speak about your mother
More and more I get the feeling that something serious has happened to my mother.
So if disturbing your sleep in the middle of the night helps me find her, I have no regrets.
That is the most sincere thing you have said to me since we began.
Stay cautious
My mother's future was perhaps at stake. I don't wish to say any more.
So you are prepared to take great risks for someone dear to your heart...
Yes, I am.
I understand how you must feel.
Share the information.
I overheard a conversation between a French soldier and some other individual...
And what were they talking about?
It seems mother is involved, something about a military campaign...
Apparently my mother validated an order of cannons to help this man...
Really? Since when does the Order finance wars?
As far as I know, since never.
Did they give any details, a date, what they were for?
Nothing at all, did you know anything about this?
No.. but I won't forget. Thank you.
Share the information.
Keep quiet.
...
Your silence bores me, Louis!
In that case, I will say no more.
Keep quiet.
HB calms down a little...
All right Louis, I might have overreacted a bit.
Please do excuse me, but next time, please try knocking on my door. I'd be delighted to open it for you.
Oh! Well, I'll remember in that case. Good night, Emily.
However, this key stays with me.
Good night, Louis.
HB gets angry and throws you out.
You have been a great disappointment to me. Please leave now!
And don't try asking me for your key if you want your empty head to stay attached to your neck.
Don't move!
Emily?
Louis?

Perhaps, but remain still.

That is the most sincere thing you have said to me since we began.
Stay cautious
My mother's future was perhaps at stake. I don't wish to say any more.
So you are prepared to take great risks for someone dear to your heart...
Yes, I am.
I understand how you must feel.
Share the information.
I overheard a conversation between a French soldier and some other individual...
And what were they talking about?
It seems mother is involved, something about a military campaign...
Apparently my mother validated an order of cannons to help this man...
Really? Since when does the Order finance wars?
As far as I know, since never.
Did they give any details, a date, what they were for?
Nothing at all, did you know anything about this?
No.. but I won't forget. Thank you.
Share the information.
Keep quiet.
...
Your silence bores me, Louis!
In that case, I will say no more.
Keep quiet.
HB calms down a little...
All right Louis, I might have overreacted a bit.
Please do excuse me, but next time, please try knocking on my door. I'd be delighted to open it for you.
Oh! Well, I'll remember in that case. Good night, Emily.
However, this key stays with me.
Good night, Louis.
HB gets angry and throws you out.
You have been a great disappointment to me. Please leave now!
And don't try asking me for your key if you want your empty head to stay attached to your neck.
Excuse me. Am I bothering you?
Yes
I was sleeping.
I need your help.
What's going on?
No
No, not in the least. Is something wrong?
I'm going to need your help.
Do you remember the young lady we spoke of in the hall?
No
No. What's her name again?
Elizabeth Adams.
Yes
Elizabeth Adams, Holm introduced her to us.
Yes.
Yes
I… I bumped into her in the small salon before.
Well, she is the daughter of my friend the vice-president, John Adams.
But she is supposed to be dead!
That's bizarre. Fair enough!
Good heavens! I was present at her funeral!
It is disturbing indeed.
Yes. I need to make sure it's her. That's where you come in.
I want you to distract Elizabeth while I search her room.
And perhaps get my hands on some important information. At least, I hope so.
Elizabeth is in the small salon. If you hurry, you can still catch her.
I just need ten minutes.
Washington has really made me curious to know more about Adams.
If my vision is true, there're two men nearby discussing very important issues and one of them looks much like Mortimer.
Help George Washington
Count on me, sir.
Thank you, my friend.
Keep Elizabeth downstairs as long as possible! She must not return to her room!
Trust me!
Investigate about your vision
Washington is very kind, but I came to this island for my mother, not for his ghost stories.
Sir, I don't feel well. I'm going to have to decline.
I see... Well I hope you won't be needing my help one day.
I must act swiftly, I'll search my room later.

We had the same room!  I have to search it!
Shit.
I'm coming!
We had the same room!  I have to search it!
Shit.
I'm coming!
I can't hear anything here. I've got to find another spot.
I can't hear anything here. I've got to find another spot.
Well? Did you get time to search the room?
Louis... I only needed ten minutes!
Imagine the scandal if she had found me!
What would you have done in my shoes? She was in the middle of an argument with some angry guy.
Ten minutes! I didn't ask for the moon!
Nonetheless you found what you were looking for, didn't you?
Not everything, but yes, Elizabeth is definitely the daughter of John Adams. We need more information.
You can always go back...
It's too late now.
Yes, I found out... many things.
Good!
Did Elizabeth give you any trouble?
Elizabeth? No.
Well, you could have mentioned she was with a raving maniac, huh.
What do you mean?
She was with a Frenchman. He was about to beat her when I arrived.
What the devil are you talking about?
I thought he was gonna kill the poor girl...
Did you intervene?
I did what was necessary to give you enough time to search her room.
Good work, my friend! I knew that I could count on you!
So tell me, did you find any information?
Oh... yes …  
Is everything all right?
What I found is likely to upset you...
What do you mean by that?
Tell me now!
Elizabeth is indeed the daughter of John Adams.
Why pass her off as dead?
I found her medical file. It appears that for many years your mother was... her personal doctor.
From what I read, she behaved more like a butcher than a doctor...
What are you talking about?
Defend mother's honor
But, you're her friend, how can you call her a butcher?
The entire medical file is annotated and signed in her own hand.
Under what name? My mother uses at least ten aliases when she's on a case.
These documents are signed by Dr Beth Mopa.
Forestall Washington
An anagram of Baphomet... an occult figure.
Yes.
Well, mother used this alias only on a few rare sordid missions.
An anagram of "Baphomet".
... an occult figure your mother was fond of whenever she was on a mission and wished to avoid justifying her actions.
That is... perhaps a coincidence.
I'd like it to be.
Let Washington explain
I'm not a child. What's going on here?
John believed that his daughter was possessed.
He appealed to your mother to save her but... the treatment she inflicted on the poor child... my God …  
Look, stop beating around the bush! What exactly did she do to her?
Do you believe your mother capable of torturing a child?
Yes, in the name of duty
My mother got her hands dirty for the common good, so don't be too quick to judge her!
For the common good? We're talking about the vivisection of a child! Of tattooing her from head to foot with a red hot iron!
Stop, stop this!
For her fifth birthday, she inflicted the stigmata of Christ on her.
And for her tenth birthday, a hysterectomy. What kind of gift is that for a child?
No
My... my mother would never do something like that!
But she did. And with the blessing of the Order.
No, no she... she wouldn't go that far. Prove it, show me that file!
I left it in her room so as not to arouse suspicion.
My mother is not a monster.
I do not doubt that your mother meant well.
But the techniques described in the file... it is pure torture.
Refuse Washington's account
My mother has many faults but she's not the cruel woman you describe.
Believe what you will, but now you cannot say you were never told.
Accept Washington's version
I... please …  I need some time alone.
I have seen some horrors in my time but if what is written in these damn documents is true...
Be brave, my boy.

A perfect read for anyone with a surfeit of ambition.
That might come in handy.

Sir, I understand your eagerness but the pressure on my family complicates the task.
Relax, my friend. Your relatives will soon be safe.
So what I saw in my vision really did happen...
I hope I haven't missed anything important.
… I... thank you so much.
Don't mention it. Now that's settled, let us speak about your support.
Yes. You mentioned earlier some assistance from the Golden Order?
Absolutely, I have concluded an agreement with their leader: Lady Sarah Faustine De Richet.
Another case that mother didn't tell me about...
The funds from the Order will finance the building of a foundry in Tuscany
You will soon be able to count on a hundred or more cannons for your future campaigns.
I... I was not expecting... so much help from you. When can I meet this de Richet?
Well, unfortunately, something has... cropped up. De Richet has disappeared.
Disappeared? What, here?
Yes, but the staff are redoubling efforts to find her, I assure you.
So, the agreement; is it on or off?
It is on. Her right-hand man has just arrived here to help us find her. And it is none other than her son... Louis Mauras de Richet.
I wager he will ensure his mother's commitments are met.
Louis... not an easy name to live with in these times.
Huh of course, but from now on you will deal with him.
This man... it can only be Mortimer...  
Very well, I will seek him out.
Oh, shit!
Hide
That was a close call!
I'd better get away from here!
When you see Louis, speak to him about the amount of our agreement.
And how much exactly are we talking about?
Twenty thousand Louis d'or?
A sum that will enable you to easily win your next conquests
My friend, an unparalleled destiny awaits you in France.
That is very flattering, however, is twenty thousand Louis d'or enough to purchase so many cannons?
In this case, yes. Madame de Richet and I have negotiated a very good price.
Very well. You can count on me to talk with her son.
Perfect. Remember that great things can be achieved with him on your side.
Of course. Anything else?
Not for now. Try to get some rest. The next few days are likely to be tiring.
Then Sir, I bid you a Good evening.
Good evening, my friend.
It's time to leave...

"Records of the Police".
Notes intended for the police lieutenant of Paris.
It's a list of people under surveillance in Paris. And there are some well known names on it.
This is valuable information... This shouldn't be lying around.
So and so goes for a walk everyday from nine to ten o'clock in the Jardin du Luxembourg,
while another spends his time in a caf? where he spouts out his ideas against the revolution.

Ah, my son! Oh, you are a godsend!
What's the matter, Your Eminence?
I believe Miss Adams may be in danger.
What do you mean?
Do you hear that? She is being manhandled in the small salon.
By whom?
I don't know exactly...
A thug... a Frenchman it seems. By the cut of his cloth, I'd say he's a member of the French revolutionary government.
You should do something, my son.
I'm going in.
Shit. I was supposed to make sure Adams wouldn't go back to her room...
Don't worry, Your Eminence. I'll take care of it. Probably nothing to worry about.
Do you want me to call for help?
Please don't do anything. I'm sure with a little good will, everything will work out fine.
... don't go and wake up the whole manor, please.
Thank you, my son. May God watch over you.
Sounds dangerous
You're right, that sounds like it might be bad.
Good Lord, that's all I needed! How am I supposed to keep Adams busy now?
Do you know if the man is armed?
No, I don't. I barely saw him.
If this thing starts to sound serious, call the servants for help.
I certainly will.
Why should I be the one to go?
Come on, this guy's a Cardinal?
Weren't you about to enter the room, Your Eminence?
Oh, no, no. I was just passing by.
But, since I do happen to be here, shall we go in together, now?
I'd rather go and find help. It's safer.
Well, let's see...
It's always the same ones who get the shit jobs!

It's always the same ones who get the shit jobs!
Your Eminence? What are you doing here?
I was worried about you, my son. How did it go, with Miss Adams?
Problem solved
Don't worry about that anymore, Your Eminence. I had to step in, but everything's under control.
Ha! What an adventure, my son! Ah, I am relieved to hear it.
You acted as a good christian. In these troubled times, we need more men of your caliber.
It's nothing, Your Eminence. I did what I had to do.
While you did the opposite...
Good. Well, thanks for the news.
It's settled, no thanks to you, though...
Everything went well, there's no need to worry.
Which means?
The situation was more complex than it looked at first glance.
What? The poor child was indeed being bullied by a thug, wasn't she?
Let's just say you didn't have a complete picture of the situation, Your Eminence.
Maybe it's because it's harder to feel things when one is sheltered... behind the door.
Huh now... listen to me, my son, I went in search of the servants!
You weren't able to find them, were you?
No! And they are going to hear from me! When you need them most, you simply can't find them!
Anyway. Miss Adams is safe, everything's fine. So no need to lose any sleep over it.
I see. Thank you, my son.
He's bitten the dust.
You're right: some ill-mannered ape was clearly threatening her. I had to intervene.
I hope that Your Eminence will forgive me, I had to resort to violence. It was the only language he seemed to understand.
I won't hold it against you. You did what you could, but the situation called for quick action!
But not from you...
Of course, I personally disapprove of any form of violence. But I am sure what you did was for the best.
The end justifies the means...
It could have been worse. Let's say that Miss Adams will remember it for a couple of days.
What? Did you not intervene?
Of course not, what did you want me to do? That thug could have snapped me in half in two seconds!
So you prefer to let that fragile young lady take a beating, rather than risk getting slapped around a bit yourself?
Mr De Richet, your mother would not have been proud of you!
Listen, next time it happens, join me instead of hiding behind the door. If you're gonna talk big, back it up!
You should be ashamed. I will pray for your soul, my son.
My son, I have another problem.
I wanted to speak to you about something important.
Do you still have my letter on you? The one I gave you in the hall?
Why do you ask?
I have a name to add to it.
Give back the letter
Here it is.
Thank you, my son.
Ah, I see it's still sealed. I was right to put my trust in you, Louis.
Give me one second please...
I can't imagine what would have happened if I hadn't added this name to the list...
Please, be sure to give this letter to Sarah the moment you see her...
You can count on it.
Give back the letter
Here... Here it is.
You opened it !
Don't worry about that, Your Eminence.
You gave me your word!  Before God!
I can assure you that my mother and I share everything.
That's enough! Your word is worthless! I'll give your mother this letter myself!
Lie to him!
It would have been my pleasure, but I don't have it with me, Your Eminence
Why is that?
You remember that I came here to meet my mother. Well, I still haven't found her, and It's beginning to worry me.
Given the importance of your letter, and not knowing where it all might lead me, I've hidden it.
His Eminence wouldn't want me to take the slightest risk, would he?
Excellent initiative, my son!
Uh, But please tell me you haven't simply left it in your room, my son?
Don't worry, it is perfectly safe and sound.
Certainly, but where?
Oh, I'm sorry but I'm not at liberty to say. The walls have ears here, and I refuse to put any of these good people in danger.
Give me the name you wanted to add and I'll pass it on to my mother.
Very well, you seem to know what you're doing.
Here is the name: Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel.
I know him!
Jean-Baptiste Gobel is the Archbishop of Paris, right?
In person!
But I thought he renounced his vows and office a few months ago.
My son, with the internal war that is being waged between Mr Hébert and de Robespierre, it could be that Gobel is serving as an example.
Don't forget to give this name to your mother, or a good man will end up dead.
Are you prepared to trust me, or not?
Of course, my son.
Have a good night.
Your Eminence? What are you doing here?
I was worried about you, my son. How did it go, with Miss Adams?

Tell me, my good man.
Sir?
Question the servant
Whose room is this?
A guest.
Apparently, a French soldier.
All right...
Perhaps I should change my approach
Give the servant a task
Listen. I'm an insomniac and...
... Sir Holm told me that you could go to the kitchen and make me a cup of herbal tea.
And what is in this herbal tea, sir?
Holm gave Washington a recipe for a sleeping draught, what was it again?
Pepper mint, clover and celery powder
Peppermint, clover and celery powder?
You won't sleep with that, sir.
Pepper mint, lime-flower and valerian
Peppermint, lime flower and valerian.
Ginger, red chili pepper and clove
Ginger, red pepper and cloves?
That's not it.
Remember my vision
Peppermint, lime flower and valerian!
Get rid of the servant
Are you really gonna make me recite an entire recipe for herbal tea?
Do you want me to wake Holm to ask if it needs three cabbage leaves or two spoonfuls of honey?
No... of course not... I'll prepare it for you, Sir. My apologies.
I... yes, it's... herbal tea. I... I'll go and make it for you at once, Sir.
I'll wait for you in my room.
Pretend I have an urgent message
I have an urgent letter to send!
My instructions are clear, Sir. No one is to enter.
Does the word "urgent" mean nothing to you?
Yes, but, the word "liar" also means something.
That won't work, Louis.
Scare him
Let me through. I'm in a hurry and they've already begun!
Sorry Sir, but no one is permited to enter.
First, you delayed me at the dock. Then, at the buffet, you spilled red wine all over me.
Then, you put my luggage in the wrong room.
It... It wasn't me, Sir.
Don't try to trick me with the masks like last year!
You've taken a dislike to me and I don't know why, but it's too much!  Let's pay a visit to Sir Holm right now!
I beg you Sir, please, enter... my apologies, and I hope the rest of your stay will prove satisfactory.
Leave
I need to find a place to watch undisturbed.
Tell me, my good man.
Sir?
Question the servant
Whose room is this?
A guest.
Apparently, a French soldier.
All right...
Perhaps I should change my approach
Give the servant a task
Listen. I'm an insomniac and...
... Sir Holm told me that you could go to the kitchen and make me a cup of herbal tea.
And what is in this herbal tea, sir?
Holm gave Washington a recipe for a sleeping draught, what was it again?
Pepper mint, clover and celery powder
Peppermint, clover and celery powder?
You won't sleep with that, sir.
Pepper mint, lime-flower and valerian
Peppermint, lime flower and valerian.
Ginger, red chili pepper and clove
Ginger, red pepper and cloves?
That's not it.
Remember my vision
Peppermint, lime flower and valerian!
Get rid of the servant
Are you really gonna make me recite an entire recipe for herbal tea?
Do you want me to wake Holm to ask if it needs three cabbage leaves or two spoonfuls of honey?
No... of course not... I'll prepare it for you, Sir. My apologies.
I... yes, it's... herbal tea. I... I'll go and make it for you at once, Sir.
I'll wait for you in my room.
Pretend I have an urgent message
I have an urgent letter to send!
My instructions are clear, Sir. No one is to enter.
Does the word "urgent" mean nothing to you?
Yes, but, the word "liar" also means something.
That won't work, Louis.
Scare him
Let me through. I'm in a hurry and they've already begun!
Sorry Sir, but no one is permited to enter.
First, you delayed me at the dock. Then, at the buffet, you spilled red wine all over me.
Then, you put my luggage in the wrong room.
It... It wasn't me, Sir.
Don't try to trick me with the masks like last year!

Leave

Good evening, Sir. I'm sorry, but an important meeting is under way. My instructions are to let no one pass.
I see, so that's where it's happening, in that room. Now I've just got to find a way in there.

Lady Adams must have locked it behind her when she fled.

Louis, you're straying from your objective.
Louis, you're straying from your objective.
That's not the right way.
That's not the right way.
I recognize this part of the corridor.
I'm close.
I recognize this part of the corridor.
I'm close.
The servants put clean laundry here.
Maybe there's a key here somewhere
The service key! I was right!
Search for a service key
There's... there's something at the bottom …  
That looks like a service key. Let's try it.

A service key!
Move away

Your turn.
The servants are not very efficient.
De Richet can't be far away, they'll find her soon.
Their search time is restricted given that they must keep an eye on Adams.
I can take care of her, you know.
Yes... Well, in any case, I do thank you for bringing her to the island.
From what I've understood, the search of de Richet's room hasn't turned up any results.
Not yet, no. But we've put her son in there, perhaps he'll find something.
That might come in handy.
Louis grows impatient at not yet having met the famous Lord Mortimer.
He will meet him tomorrow.
At last! Perhaps the entire Golden Order won't be turning up after all.
The Order is already there.
Oh, what a pity to lose a knight at the start of the game.
Are you waiting for someone?
A young French soldier.
During our game of chess?
Show him in.
Don't worry Gregory. The game won't disappear.
I'll have one of my men escort you back.
Don't trouble yourself, I know my way out.
Ah, good evening, gentlemen. Please forgive me for this late hour.
It is never too late. And, we have much to discuss.
One last move?
Don't worry, our games always seem to end like this.
Or always start like this.,,
Take a seat, my friend.

A little night time stroll, mister President?
There's nothing like it for a good night's sleep.
Do not hesitate to ask a servant to show you back.
The corridors seem quite safe!
Pepper mint, lime-flower and valerian. My miracle remedy when one can't get to sleep. A very good night to you, Mr President.
Thank you, and to you too, sir.
