Emily?
Come in, Louis...
Oh! God... Louis, your arm! What happened?
Right, so now she notices?
Erm I... I had an accident, but don't worry about it... Really, I'd rather not talk about it.
But... you...
Please...
It would take too long to explain.
Very well then... I shan't insist.
I see you still don't trust me...
Speak to her about the servant
You're not alone?
I've inherited one of Mortimer's personal guards because he's worried about my health.
But don't worry, we can talk. All the servants dressed in black are deaf and dumb.
Don't raise the question
...
I wanted to talk to you about what happened...
I'd rather not, Louis.
What happened in the past is in the past. Talking about it won't change a thing.
Sarah wasn't my mother... She abducted me and lied to me all my life...
We are mere pawns...
I... Louis... About what happened on the wharf, I'm so sorry, really...
I hope you'll be able to forgive me one day...
What's in the past is in the past, right?
I'd rather not talk about it if you don't mind.
You wanted to speak to me?
Yes...
Louis, you have to tell her about the Daemons...
I've got something important to tell you...
About what happened here...
I'm listening...
Mortimer and Holm...
They are Daemons and you are like them...
I know you told me the truth about Mortimer and Holm...
I know they are daemons...
That's not all...
Go on...
I'm like them, Emily. I'm also a Daemon.
I know.
What?... how do you know?
Sir Gregory came to speak to me earlier...
At great length.
I'm his niece, Louis.
I'm Mortimer's child too.
You're my sister?
Surprise!
Er... wh...I... it's... but...
I have a sister...
That's right... and I have a brother.
I didn't see that one coming...
So that means that what we did...
Louis!
I would rather we never mention what may have happened between us, please.
I'm trying very hard not to break down. In just a few days my whole life has fallen apart and I'd like to try to retain some dignity.
Of course...
Emily? Emily, it's me.
Come in, Louis.
I just saw that...
What's that servant doing in your room?
A gift from Father.
You're joking, right?
Unfortunately not.
He's worried about my health.
Ah, typical! Of course I understand this is in no way an overreaction on his part...
Anyway, I've come to see if you're better...
That's very nice of you, thank you.
I'd appreciate it if we kept our last discussion to ourselves, Louis.
I'm not very proud of the state I was in.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
And did you manage to speak to Mortimer?
One moment, I'd rather continue our discussion away from any curious eyes.
Follow me next door, please.
You wanted to know if we spoke?
Well, let's just say he didn't stick around long but yes, I can definitely say we spoke.
What did you talk about?
Do you want to talk about it?
He urged me to change sides and join him.
Ah... that's not what I was expecting...
Yes, you can't say Father allowed himself to get sentimental...
And what did you answer?
And what did you answer?
I don't know. Hard to say.
Yet they've known each other for a long time
But if I remember rightly, you said this isn't the first time you've been entertained here.
You knew each other before, didn't you?
Yes, that's true.
He told me he didn't know the exact nature of our relationship until a short time ago.
And if it will reassure you, I'm generally pretty good at reading people and I can tell when they're lying...
With him, it's impossible to know what's real and what's not.
And how did it go?
And did it go alright?
I imagine you spoke about yourselves?
He confirmed what Sir Gregory told me, that he really is my father...
That he didn't know I was his daughter until a short while ago...
Don't insist
And how are you? Did you take it alright?
To be honest, I don't know.
I feel like I've lost all my bearings.
And what about me then...
Emily?
Come in, Louis...
Oh! God... Louis, your arm! What happened?
Hey, now she notices?
I erm... an accident, but don't worry... Really, I'd rather not speak about it.
But... you...
Please...
It would take too long to explain.
Very well then... I shan't insist.
I see you still don't trust me...

But don't worry, we can talk. All the servants dressed in black are deaf and dumb.
Don't raise the question
...
I wanted to talk to you about what happened...
I would rather not, Louis.
What happened is water under the bridge. Speaking about it won't change a thing.
Sarah wasn't my mother... She abducted me and lied to me all my life...
We are mere pawns...
I... Louis... About what happened on the wharf, I'm so sorry, really...
I hope you'll be able to forgive me one day...
No use crying over spilled milk.
I don't want to talk about it if you don't mind.
You wanted to speak to me?
Yes...
Louis, you have to tell her about the Daemons...
I've something important to tell you...
About what happened here...
I'm listening...
Mortimer and Holm...
They are Daemons and you are like them...

You're my sister?
Surprise!

I'd appreciate it if we kept our last discussion to ourselves, Louis.
I'm not very proud of the state I was in.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
And did you manage to speak to Mortimer?
Hang on, I'd rather continue our discussion away from all eyes.
Follow me, next door, please.
You wanted to know if we spoke?
Well, let's just say he didn't stick around long but yes, I can definitely say we spoke.
What did you talk about?
Do you want to speak about it?
He urged me to change sides and join him.
Ah... that's not what I was expecting...
Yes, you can't say Father allowed himself to get sentimental...
You can say that again...
And what did you answer?
That I had to think about it.
[PSYCHO] And how did it go?
And did it go alright?
I imagine you spoke about yourselves?
He confirmed what Sir Gregory told me, that he really is my father...
That he didn't know I was his daughter until a short while ago...
Yet they've known each other for a long time
But if I remember rightly, you said this isn't the first time you've been entertained here.

Don't insist
And how are you? Did you take it alright?
To be honest, I don't know.
It feels like I've lost all my bearings.
And what about me then...
He'll only see Godoy... but what on earth does he want from him?
I don't understand what came over you, Johann!
It's inexcusable!
I thought I was doing the right thing... Helping you to...
Helping me?
Are you joking? You can no longer stay here!
What? But why not...
If you stay here, you are as good as dead!
You being my son changes nothing, you attacked and hurt his son! It's the rules!
Even I cannot protect you for long!
But... Father! No...
You don't know William!
If Louis dies before you get off the island, you won't be leaving alive.
So you'd better pray that he recovers...
But... You're going to...
Just shut up for once...
You're going to leave the island immediately! There's no other choice...
I couldn't have known... If I had even guessed...
It's too late.
Make haste! Don't say goodbye to anyone! You will probably never see them again, anyway! I'll apologize to them on your behalf.
So... so I have to go?
I'll meet you in Berlin! Hurry now!
Are you leaving, sir?
Yes, well...I find myself...
Johann!
Ah, Duke Manuel...
Sir Gregory...
Thank you for agreeing to this meeting...
I wanted to make it clear that I am particularly disappointed by your change of sides and to let you know that from now on, you have definitively lost my support.
Come now, sir, there is no point...
No point in continuing with this discussion, I entirely agree.
You are wasting my time.
Good luck for the future. From now on, you're on your own.
Oh dear... I do believe I've just ruined Godoy's political career...
Duke Manuel...
Sir Gregory...
Mr von Wöllner is leaving?
Indeed, alas... Some business that simply can't wait.
But don't worry. Our plans haven't changed. We shall easily win the vote.
At this rate, there won't be anyone left TO vote...
I trust you completely.
Duke Manuel, here you are at last...
Sir Gregory, Mr von Wöllner...
Thank you for agreeing to this meeting...
I shan't beat about the bush, my friend.
I was very disappointed by your behavior. I had thought you more... loyal.
Consequently, my affection for you leads me to ask you to reconsider one last time...
I've already reconsidered it, Sir Gregory.
I shall be loyal to you when it comes to the vote. Have no doubt about it.
Excellent news indeed, my friend!
Did you hear, Johann?
Yes, and it comes at a most timely moment. I anticipate an overwhelming victory.
It goes without saying to keep it to yourself.
I would like to give William a nice surprise.
Whatever you say.
I'll leave you with Johann a while.
I still have a few things to settle.
I shan't be long...
See you later, Sir Gregory...
Oh, Godoy.
Come over here, I'm warming myself up.
I had the misfortune to step outside and I'm frozen solid ...
SUCCESS
I wonder what he was doing outside.
Something to do with what Holm asked him for, maybe...
He's back from the landing stage...
Damn, he must have gone to deposit Al Azif for someone to pick up...
(default)
Mr von Wöllner... I wanted to speak to you.
I'd like to make you an offer you can't refuse.
I'm all ears.
Now, we don't have much time, so here it is...
You will vote for Mortimer.
What a strange idea, Godoy! You are being ridiculous!
Tell me now, why would I do that?
Don't blackmail him for Piaggi
Blackmail him for Piaggi
Because I know you poisoned Piaggi.
I... But...
Is this a joke?
Certainly not.
And you know full well it isn't.
If Mortimer, or even Holm, finds out that you assassinated a guest during a conference, you are finished and you know it.
You filthy scumbag!
I didn't know you were this kind of man, Godoy!
And so?
Alright, alright. I'll vote for Mortimer...
Thank you, sir.
See you later...
Holm lied to us, he only serves his own interests
Sir Gregory has been taking us for a ride right from the start.
When it comes to this operation, he isn't championing the interests of our respective nations.
All he cares about is beating Lord Mortimer at his own game.
Oh, come, Manuel, where are you getting this from?
Name me even one decision by Sir Gregory that was in favor of Prussia.
My God, man, I didn't know you were so excessive.
You don't want to answer.
I will, just let me think...
You're pinned down. You will only get mere crumbs out of Poland. It will go to Russia.
And I hope you're ready for a global war because I doubt France will agree to our coalition.
True, said like that, I don't know....
I'm not criticizing, I'm in the same boat as you.
Spain will docilely follow Holm without getting anything in return!
Holm's playing with Louisiana even though it doesn't belong to him
Louisiana is Spanish... Consequently, I'm best placed to know what to do with it.
It's turning into a personal stake between Gregory and William.
Honestly, would you like it if someone told you what to do with Royal Prussia and Greater Poland?
Well... it depends...
No, don't try smoothing things over. You are a statesman, you know what I mean.
Today, Spain is weighed down by Louisiana, a source of epidemics, insurrections...
It prevents us from concentrating on exploiting the wealth in the western territories.
And I have to let Gregory decide?
I understand your point of view, but as far as I'm concerned I would rather be honest...
Holm has nothing to risk
Because Holm is finished.
And he isn't worth us sinking with him as he goes down.
Because after all, we're the ones taking all the risks. If Sir Gregory loses this conference, in actual fact, he loses nothing at all.
Ah, be quiet, Godoy! You don't know what you're talking about.
Sir Gregory has more to lose here than anyone. He serves people high up who might not forgive him if he fails!
Whereas the only risk you run is a call to order from your King.
But I trust you... you can always implore your Queen!
This is not a good start
Holm is on his own without any power
Because Holm doesn't really know what he's doing.
He reacts indiscriminately. He is isolated.
Don't underestimate his capacities.
He's far from being on his own. Just one word from him and nations will rise up in his support.
He no longer has any allies, look around for God's sake!
Allies?
He doesn't care about allies! Once back on the continent, he will raise armies willing to die for him!
They will all fall to their knees just to serve him!
Because you are making a big mistake on one point! He has no end of power!
Right... not a great start...
[MINDREADER]
Damn traitor is about to drop us!
You are wasting your time, Duke Manuel.
You know nothing about me and your attempts to manipulate me have no effect.
You behave as though we were close, yet ever since you arrived you've only been interested in your own little self!
Don't say that, Johann, we may not be friends, but we are allies.
Is that so? And what do you know about me exactly?
You loved Elizabeth Adams
I know for example that you felt a strong... attachment for Miss Adams.
I... But... How?
You weren't there!
As I said, we are allies.
I never lose touch with my allies. I take care of my allies. And when they are afflicted with grief, I sympathize.
I... I didn't speak about it to anyone...
No, and that's perfectly normal. It's your secret.
Thanks, all the same.
You found Al Azif for Holm
You are loyal and discreet. Just look at how you managed to get your hands on Al Azif for Gregory...
But how...
Well, I'm more attentive than you seem to think.
The fact remains, I was able to admire your expertise.
There wasn't a great deal to it in actual fact.
I wouldn't exactly call him modest!
I don't know whether or not Gregory realizes how lucky he is to have you in his ranks, but for my part, I know a great man when I see one.
I... thank you, Duke Manuel.
You've stolen Mortimer's maps
I know you've stolen Mortimer's geopolitical maps.
I've no idea what you're talking about.
They're hidden in your room.
But how the devil did you find out?
You'll soon learn that I always keep an eye out for my friends, sir.
In case they need me.
Well...
And you need me. Right now.
Continue...
It's true, I don't know anything about him
Not much, admitedly. But it's never too late...
Indeed, I would very much like to find out more about you.
It's never too late to...
Oh! And as luck would have it, just before the final vote?
You make me laugh, Duke Manuel... Really!
But I am being serious, really!
It's indeed the worst...
You're not dealing with a child, you know!
[MINDREADER]
If he knew I was Gregory's son...
He wouldn't try it on like this!
Other
You tried to poison Louis.
I might surprise you, Johann...
Oh! That's a rather facile approach to take, I would have expected more form you.
Like the attempted murder of young de Richet?
Pardon? Now, now, listen here...
Have no fear. If I wanted to talk about it, I would have done so already...
I am outraged, I...
Stop this farce! I couldn't care less if you wanted to have a go at him.
What matters to me now, is you understand that we have common interests.
Keep going, I'm listening...
You are Holm's son.
About you? Next to nothing... Except that you happen to be Sir Gregory Holm's son, right?
What? What do you mean?
But... I... I...
Ah! Now, I'm starting to be of interest to you, no?
I've never spoken to anyone about that!
Quite surprising, isn't it?
You see, I'm full of surprises.
In short, whether he's your father or not makes no real difference to me.
Speak for yourself.
Hahahaha! Come on, Johann, don't make me laugh. He has never thought of you as his son.
I'd wager that you'd always hoped he would one day, even though he treated you like a master treats a usefull slave.
He is at best... a mentor.
Stop me if I'm wrong.
...
Go back.
But tell me, why do you want to follow Mortimer all of a sudden?
Mortimer is planning something.
We don't know everything, he must have something up his sleeve to be so confident.
Ah, really? And what do you think that might be?
[MINDREADER]
Let's see what he knows...
How the devil did he find out that I'm Holm's son?
He will kill anyone who opposes him
He intends to get rid of all those unwilling to give their support to him.
You can't be serious! Look, you've seen as well I have who's here, haven't you?
This is insane...
Johann... One thing is certain. Mortimer never gives in.
I think he is perfectly capable of making a clean sweep and starting over again if he thinks he has no other options...
After all, who would complain? People everywhere crying out against oppression?
But... These conferences take place according to rules! Have you forgotten?
We are talking about Lord William Mortimer here...
Do you really believe he would stop at breaking a few rules?
No, no, probably not.
He can control all of us
Mortimer is a Daemon, Johann! We have no chance of winning with Gregory...
Do you have any idea what you are talking about?
I know how it sounds, but I'm asking you to believe me!
He can take control of any one of us, Johann and...
Shut up! I don't know how you found out, but hold your damn tongue!
I know what Mortimer is.
And Holm is one too! And they are not the only ones, believe me!
He has already had dealings with people above us
All of this is just a show.
He has contacted all those we represent...
What do you mean?
That everything is already decided in higher spheres...
William Frederick... the king of Spain, the Pope, William Pitt...
I don't understand...
Lord Mortimer has invited those who work in the wings of power to take a hand in swaying the decisions of those who actually hold it.
Everything is already played out! He has already won!
But how is this possible?
We've all underestimated him!
He's fooled us... we're done for...
Look, it all hinges on the next few hours, Johann...
Mortimer has enough to blackmail Sir Gregory
I've heard things.
What are you talking about?
It would seem that Lord Mortimer has Sir Gregory under his thumb! He has something on him that frightens him.
What on earth are you talking about?
I'm not sure but I'm convinced that Holm won't go through with total opposition, and in the end, he will do whatever Lord Mortimer tells him to.
All of this is just a facade so he doesn't lose face! Holm is like a cornered rat!
Listen, I haven't the foggiest what you are spouting on about but Sir Gregory has never been afraid!
I don't know what you're playing at, Godoy, but this isn't the kind of argument that's gonna make me follow you!
Look, I hear everything you're saying but there is no chance that Mortimer can make us all change sides.
That is why, Sir Gregory can but win! You understa...
Think again. It's already too late...
[MINDREADER]
I'm getting a bad feeling!
There's only you left
Now, you're the last one left...
Your loyalty toward Gregory is honorable but no longer makes any sense.
If you don't change your mind you'll be venturing into dangerous waters for no valid reason...
Unless it's to win...
Yes, but at what price?
Think of all those who... who will be hostile toward you afterwards... Just think about it rationally a minute...
Prussia has nothing directly at stake, so why put your position or your life in the balance...
I'm leaving Holm
As for me, I can no longer follow Sir Gregory.
If I claim the contrary, it's only to avoid any reprisals. But the situation really is just too risky...
Fear... You are guided by fear!
Well... When you think the future of entire nations is at stake here...
Filthy traitor!
All the guests already serve Mortimer!
We have all joined Lord Mortimer. That leaves only you and...
And that will suffice for us to win the conference.
I see you coming, Manuel... That is no argument!
I am no damn lackey!
De Richet has persuaded all of them of to join Mortimer
That clever De Richet turned them all against...
What the...
All of them... One by one he somehow persuaded them to join Mortimer.
But... no... no, that's impossible!
It looks like all of us have seriously underestimated him...
While we all thought he was running around after his poor mother, he was actually accomplishing the tour de force of winning us all over, one after the other.
You're the only one left, Johann.
I dare not imagine what Mortimer will do if he finds out you are against him. Because from now on, you're on your own!
Good luck...
No, no, wait!...
Good Outcome
I... I hear you.
Honestly, betraying Gregory is... Well, it's... it's unthinkable...
Unless I simply don't have any choice...
Yes! He's finally cracked!
What do you mean?
I mean... if... if no one supports Gregory before my turn to vote, I will vote for Mortimer.
But if anyone else votes for Gregory, I will be his strongest advocate!
Is that clear?
Crystal clear!
Thank you, Manuel.
Thank you for warning me...
You're welcome. There is nothing more natural between allies!
I did what I could. Now, it's up to you.
As for me, I'll vote for Mortimer!
Good luck to you!
Good luck...
Bad Outcome
Now you're going to listen to me, you filthy traitor!
Not only do I count on voting for Holm, but once we've won the conference, it will give me great pleasure to track down all those who betrayed him and make them wish they'd never been born!
Now, is that clear?
Perfectly.
But I did warn you...
That's right, now get out of here!
Good luck...
Dammit! That's not going to please Mortimer...
I don't understand what came over you, Johann!
It's inexcusable!
I thought I was doing the right thing... Helping you to...
Helping me?
Are you joking? You can no longer stay here!
What? But why not...
If you stay here, you are as good as dead!
You being my son changes nothing, you attacked and hurt his son! It's the rules!
Even I cannot protect you for long!
But... Father! No...
You don't know William!
If Louis dies before you get off the island, you won't be leaving alive.
So you'd better pray that he recovers...
But... You want to...
Just shut up for once...

Too late.
Make haste! Don't say goodbye to anyone! You will probably never see them again, anyway! I'll apologize to them on your behalf.

Because after all, we're the ones taking all the risks. If Sir Gregory loses this conference, in actual fact, he loses nothing at all.
Be quiet, Godoy! You don't know what you're talking about.
Sir Gregory has more to lose here than anyone. He serves people high up who might not forgive him if he fails!
Whereas the only risk you run is a call to order from your King.
But I trust you... you can always implore your Queen!
This is not a good start
Holm is on his own without any power
Because Holm doesn't really know what he's doing.
He reacts indiscriminately. He is isolated.
Don't underestimate his capacities.
He is far from being on his own. Just one word from him and nations will rise up in his support.
He no longer has any allies, look around for God's sake!
Allies?
He doesn't care about allies! Once back on the continent, he will raise armies willing to die for him!
They will all fall to their knees just to serve him!
Because you are making a big mistake on one point! He has no end of power!
Right... not a great start...
[MINDREADER]
Damn traitor is about to drop us!
You are wasting your time, Duke Manuel.
You know nothing about me and your attempts to manipulate me have no effect.
You behave as though we were close, yet ever since you arrived you've only been interested in your own little self!
Don't say that, Johann, we may not be friends, but we are allies.
Is that so? And what do you know about me exactly?
[IF TAG] You loved Elizabeth Adams
I know for example that you felt a strong... attachment for Miss Adams.
I... But... How?
You weren't there!
As I said, we are allies.
And I never lose touch with my allies. I take care of my allies. And when they are afflicted with grief, I sympathize.
I... I didn't speak about it to anyone...
No, and that's perfectly normal. It's your secret.
Thanks, all the same.
[IF TAG] You found Al Azif for Holm.
You are loyal and discreet. Just look at how you managed to get your hands on Al Azif for Gregory...
But how...
Well, I'm more attentive than you seem to think.
The fact remains, I was able to admire your expertise.
There wasn't a great deal to it in actual fact.
I wouldn't exactly call him modest!
I don't know whether or not Gregory realizes how lucky he is to have you in his ranks, but for my part, I know a great man when I see one.
I... thank you, Duke Manuel.
[IF TAG] You've stolen Mortimer's maps
I know you've stolen Mortimer's geopolitical maps.
I've no idea what you're talking about.
They are hidden in your room.
But how the devil did you find out?
You'll soon learn that I always keep an eye out for my friends, sir.
In case they need me.
Well...
And you need me.  Right now.
Continue...
It's true, I don't know anything about him
Not much, admitedly. But it's never too late...
Indeed, I would very much like to find out more about you.
It's never too late to...
And as luck would have it, just before the final vote?
You make me laugh, Duke Manuel... Really!
But I am being serious, really!
It's indeed the worst...
You're not dealing with a child, you know!
[MINDREADER]
If he knew I am Gregory's son...
He wouldn't put it on like he does!
Other
[IF TAG] You tried to poison Louis.
I might surprise you, Johann...
That's a rather facile approach to take, I would have expected more form you.
Like the attempted murder of young de Richet?
Pardon? Now listen here...
Have no fear. If I wanted to talk about it, I would have done so already...
I am outraged, I...
Stop this farce! I couldn't care less if you wanted to have a go at him.
What matters to me now, is you understand that we have common interests.
Keep going, I'm listening...
[IF TAG] You are Holm's son.
About you? Next to nothing... Except that you happen to be Sir Gregory Holm's son, Right ?
What do you mean?
But... I...
Ah! Now, I'm starting to be of interest to you, no?
I've never spoken to anyone about that!
Quite surprising, isn't it?
You see, I'm full of surprises.
In short, whether he's your father or not makes no real difference to me.
Speak for yourself.
Come on, Johann, don't make me laugh. He has never thought of you as his son.
I would wager that you have always hoped he would one day, even though he treated you like a master treats a usefull slave.
He is at best... a mentor.
Stop me if I'm wrong.
...
Go back.
But tell me, why do you want to follow Mortimer all of a sudden?
Mortimer is planning something.
We don't know everything, he must have something up his sleeve to be so confident.
Ah, really? And what do you think that might be?
[MINDREADER]
Let's see what he knows...
How the devil did he find out that I'm Holm's son?
[MANIPULATION] He will kill anyone who opposes him.
He intends to get rid of all those unwilling to give their support to him.
You can't be serious! Well, you've seen as well I have who's here, haven't you?
This is insane...
Johann... One thing is certain. Mortimer never gives in.
I think he is perfectly capable of making a clean sweep and starting over again if he thinks he has no other options...
After all, who would complain? People everywhere crying out against oppression?
But... But... These conferences take place according to rules! Have you forgotten?
We are talking about Lord William Mortimer here...
Do you really believe he would stop at breaking a few rules?
No, probably not.
[OCCULTISM] He can control all of us
Mortimer is a Daemon, Johann! We have no chance of winning with Gregory...
Do you have any idea about what you are talking about?
I know how it sounds, but I'm asking you to believe me!
He can take control of any one of us, Johann and...
Shut up! I don't know how you found out, but hold your damn tongue!
I know what Mortimer is.
And Holm is one too! And they are not the only ones, believe me!
[DIVERSION] He has already had dealings with people above us
All this is just a show.
He has contacted all those we represent...
What do you mean?
That everything is already decided in higher spheres...
William Frederick... the king of Spain, the Pope, William Pitt...
I don't understand...
Lord Mortimer has invited those who work in the wings of power to take a hand in swaying the decisions of those who actually hold it.
Everything is already played out! He has already won!
But how is this possible?
We've all underestimated him!
He's fooled us... we're done for...
Look, it all hinges on the next few hours, Johann...
Mortimer has enough to blackmail Sir Gregory
I've heard things.
What are you talking about?
It would seem that Lord Mortimer has Sir Gregory under his thumb! He has something on him that frightens him.
What on earth are you talking about?
I 'm not sure but I'm convinced that Holm won't go through with total opposition, and in the end, he will do whatever Lord Mortimer tells him to.
All this is just a facade so he doesn't lose face! Holm is like a cornered rat!
Listen, I haven't the foggiest what you are spouting on about but Sir Gregory has never been afraid of his brother!
I don't know what you're playing at, Godoy, but this isn't the kind of argument that's going to make me follow you!
Look, I hear everything you're saying but there is no chance that Mortimer can make us all change sides.
That is why, Sir Gregory can but win! You understa...
Think again. It's already too late...
[MINDREADER]
I have a bad feeling!
[PSYCHOLOGIE] There's only you left
Now, you are the last one left...
Your loyalty toward Gregory is honorable but no longer makes any sense.
If you don't change your mind you'll be venturing into dangerous waters for no valid reason...
Unless it's to win...
Yes, but at what price?
Think of all those who will be hostile toward you afterwards... Just think about it rationally a minute...
Prussia has nothing directly at stake, so why put your position or your life in the balance...
I'm leaving Holm
As for me, I can no longer follow Sir Gregory.
If I claim the contrary it's only to avoid any reprisals, but the situation really is just too risky...
Fear... You are guided by fear!
Well... When you think the future of entire nations is at stake here...
Filthy traitor!
All the guests already serve Mortimer!
We have all joined Lord Mortimer. That leaves only you and...
And that will suffice for us to win the conference.
I see you coming, Manuel... That is no argument!
I  am no damn lackey!
[LOGIC] De Richet has persuaded all of them of to join Mortimer
That clever De Richet turned them all against...
What the...
All of them... One by one he somehow persuaded them to join Mortimer.
But... no... that's impossible!
It looks like all of us have seriously underestimated him...
While we all thought he was running around after his poor mother, he was actually accomplishing the tour de force of winning us all over, one after the other.
You're the only one left, Johann.
And I daren't imagine what Mortimer will do if he finds out you are against him. Because from now on you're on your own!
Good luck...
No, wait!...
Good Outcome
I... I hear you.
Honestly, betraying Gregory is... Well, it's unthinkable...
Unless I simply don't have any choice...
Yes! He's finally cracked!
What do you mean?
I mean...if...if no one supports Gregory before my turn to vote, I will vote for Mortimer.
But if anyone else votes for Gregory, I will be his strongest advocate!
Is that clear?
Crystal clear!
Thank you, Manuel!
Thank you for warning me...
You're welcome. There is nothing more natural between allies!
I did what I could. Now, it's up to you.
As for me, I'll vote for Mortimer!
Good luck to you!
Good luck...
Bad Outcome
Now you're going to listen to me, you filthy traitor!
Not only do I count on voting for Holm, but once we've won the conference, it will give me great pleasure to track down all those who betrayed him and make them wish they were never born!
Is that clear?
Perfectly.
But I did warn you...
That's right, now get out of here!
Good luck...
Dammit! That's not going to please Mortimer...
I need to talk to von Wöllner.
Blast it! Holm is with him.
Gentlemen.
Louis. I'm sorry but we are waiting for Duke Manuel.
If you wouldn't mind leaving us, I should think you already have enough to do as it is.
Very well. I didn't mean to disturb you.
Just my luck! He'll only talk to the Duke...
Right, we'll have to fix that...
Here comes von Wöllner!... With Holm, of course!
The scoundrel wastes no time!
Louis, what are you doing here?
I promised you I would take care of Mr von Wöllner.
Everything's under control, don't worry.
Let me speak to him!
Now, now, I told you, I will take care of Johann personally.
Believe me, even though it pains me, he will pay the price.
Now we're waiting for Duke Manuel, so would you leave us, please?
Very well.
But you'd better keep your word, sir.
That is certainly my intention.
They're waiting for duke Manuel... No doubt to make him change sides!
All right, if they want him, then they'll get him...
I need to talk to Wöllner.
Blast it! Holm is with him.
Gentlemen.
Louis. I'm sorry but we are waiting for Duke Manuel.
If you don't mind leaving us, I should think you already have enough to do as it is.
Very well. I didn't want to disturb you.
Just my luck! He will only talk to the Duke...
Right, we'll have to fix that...
They are waiting for Godoy... No doubt to make him change sides!
Right, they are going to have him! Very opportune...
Here comes Wôllner!... With Holm, of course!
The scoundrel wastes no time!
Louis, what are you doing here?
I promised you I would take care of Mr von Wöllner.
Everything's under control, don't worry.
Let me speak to him!
I told you, I will take care of Johann personally.
Believe me, even though it pains me, he will pay the price.
Now we are waiting for Duke Manuel, so leave us alone, leave.
Very well.
You had better keep your word, sir.
That is certainly my intention.
They are waiting for Godoy... No doubt to make him change sides!
Right, if they want him, they are going to get him!
Do you trust him?
Yes
Yes, I do.
I'll follow him because, well, I think he can teach us a thing or two.
I understand.
Never! And I will bring him down
Listen Emily, I don't know if I should tell you this but...
You know, whatever you might say, I can assure you you have nothing to fear from me.
I will never trust him! Never! He's a liar and a born manipulator.
I don't believe a single word he says, he systematically presents the facts to his advantage.
I am persuaded he'd be capable of getting rid of anyone, just as soon as they're no longer of any use to him.
His vision of human management is simply sickening.
Anyway, I don't know what he's preparing but one thing is sure, I will do my utmost to bring him down.
Well, you do indeed keep your cards pretty close to your chest, don't you...
Don't say anything, Louis
Er... I don't know. It's hard to say.
He's our father, he has started to initiate me, and he's been pretty fair so far...
... now that said, you can't say he's gone about gaining my trust in the best possible way.
Am I imagining things or is she interrogating me?
What exactly are you playing at?
What do you mean?
Why are you asking me all these questions?!!
Just calm down, now.
I'm not trying to squeeze anything out of you at all.
You're getting all worked up. Calm down or you'll make yourself ill.
You really ought to get some rest.
I'm sorry, you have to excuse me.
It's true, I... I guess I'm a little... well, on edge.
After what we've been through, I can understand.
Here, take this, it will do you good.
Ah... alright. You still don't trust me, do you?
You think I'm interrogating you?
Look, we may as well stop right here in that case.
After everything we've been through together, I can see you still don't trust me.
It's nothing new either... you didn't want to tell me about the relationship between Sarah and my sister, when you found their letters in the tower room.
Please, leave me now, I would like to be alone.
Come on, don't take it like that...
I'm asking you to leave!
Wait, you...
GET OUT!
Damnit, I didn't even get a chance to talk to her about the conference...
What about you? What do you think of him?
Honestly, I no longer know who to believe.
The only one I really trust is you.
So I shall follow you this time.
Perfect.
Let's carry on pretending, we'll follow him in his project, and then, when the time comes, we'll lay down our cards.
He won't even see it coming!
So I can count on you for the conference vote then, right?
You can.
I shall support Mortimer's project.
Perfect.
Anyway, I won't keep you any longer.
See you later for the vote.
Yes, see you later.
You wanted to know if we spoke?
Well, let's just say he didn't stick around long but yes, I can definitely say we spoke.
What did you talk about?
Do... do you wanna talk about it?
He urged me to change sides and join him.
Uh... that's not what I was expecting...
Yes, you can't say Father allowed himself to get sentimental...
That is the least you can say...
And what did you answer?
That I needed to think about it.
[PSYCHO] And how did it go?
And did it go alright?
I imagine you spoke about yourselves?
He confirmed what Sir Gregory told me, that he really is my father...
That he didn't know I was his daughter until a short while ago...
Yet they've known each other for a long time
But if I remember rightly, you said this isn't the first time you've been entertained here.
You knew each other before, didn't you?
Yes, that's true.
He told me he didn't know the exact nature of our relationship until a short time ago.
And if it will reassure you, I'm generally pretty good at reading people and I can tell when they're lying...
With him, it's impossible to know what's real and what's not.
Don't insist
And how are you? Did you take it alright?
To be honest, I don't know.
I feel like I've lost all my bearings.
And what about me, then...?
Do you trust him?
Yes
Yes, I do.
I'll follow him because, well, I think he can teach us a thing or two.
I understand.
[IF DAEMON HUNTER] Never! And I will bring him down
Listen Emily, I don't know if I should tell you this but...
You know, whatever you might say, I can assure you you have nothing to fear from me.
I will never trust him! Never! He's a liar and a born manipulator.
I don't believe a single word he says, he systematically presents the facts to his advantage.
I'm persuaded he'd be capable of getting rid of anyone, just as soon as they're no longer of any use to him.
His vision of human management is simply sickening.
Anyway, I don't know what he's preparing but one thing is sure, I will do my utmost to bring him down.
Wow, you do indeed keep your cards pretty close to your chest, don't you...
[DIVERSION] Don't say anything, Louis
Er... I don't know... It... it's hard to say.
He's our father, he has started to initiate me, and he's been pretty fair so far...
Now that said, you can't say he's gone about gaining my trust in the best possible way.
Am I imagining things or is she interrogating me?
What exactly are you playing at?
What do you mean?
Why are you asking me all these questions?!!
Just calm down, now.

It's true, I... I guess I'm a little... well, on edge.
After what we've been through, I can understand.

Ah... alright. You still don't trust me, do you?
You think I'm interrogating you?

Please, leave me now, I would like to be alone.
Come on, don't take it like that...
I'm asking you to leave!
Wait, you... just...
GET OUT!
Damnit, I didn't even get a chance to talk to her about the conference...
What about you? What do you think of him?
Honestly, I no longer know who to believe.
The only one I really trust is you.
So I shall follow you this time.
Perfect.

He won't even see it coming!
So I can count on you for the conference vote then right?
You can.
I shall support Mortimer's project.
Perfect.
Anyway, I won't keep you any longer.
See you later for the vote.
Yes, see you later.
Emma?
Come in, Louis...
What can I do for you?
What with the conference soon upon us, I... I would have thought that...
You are absolutely right!
I wanted to wait a bit before talking to you, but as you are here...
I've been thinking about what we shall do once we get back.
How to arrange the house, prepare the rooms for the children... Yes, I want three and the first one will be a boy.
We shall call him Louis, like his father.
Oh man, this just keeps getting worse...
She's drifting deeper into madness.
I ought to help her!
Right, I can't exactly leave her like this...
Let alone allow her to be manipulated for the sake of this cursed conference.
Mortimer has to help her!
Please excuse me, Madam.
Just remembered I've got something to do...
Come back quickly, my love.
I... I'll see you later, Madam.
I must warn Mortimer that she can't go on like this. I'm sure he can help her.
Just too bad! She's got what she deserves!
It would almost be sad if she didn't entirely deserve it!
She wanted to play and she lost! I'm not gonna save her!
Anyway, we'll have time to talk about it later.
Regarding the conference, as we are going to vote against Mortimer's project, I thought you ought to warn Sir Gregory.
No, wait...
I'm sure he'll reserve you a prime seat at his side.
No, you don't understand...
What do you mean?
I intend to vote for Mortimer
I came to see you because I want to let you know that I'll be voting in favor of Mortimer's project.
I beg your pardon?
And I wanted to find out if you'd be willing to follow me...
With Mortimer?
You can't be serious, Louis!
Never will I follow him! Must I remind you he abandoned me when your mother tried to kill me!
Persuade her to vote for Mortimer
Emma, I think it will better if we sided with Father.
I'm sure he'll be very grateful to us.
Over my dead body!
I will never side with him! He might be my progenitor, but I refuse to follow him!
What has she got against Mortimer?
Emma, I admit he's not perfect, but what exactly is your problem with Father?
My problem?!
He never cared about us! Open your eyes!
Take a look at the opulence around you! Don't you think our lives would have been better if he had given us just a second of his attention?
Emily and I grew up in the streets!
Yes, we made it out of there, but we've only got ourselves to thank!
The Bloomsbury orphanage for young girls!
We were punished so often we were afraid to put a foot wrong... it was hell!  Hell, Louis!
Then, petty scams and tricks to pay for a miserable room where we had to spend half the night shooing away rats!
It took us ten long years before we managed to get into high society, ten years to get noticed by the queen.
And not once did he reach out to help us!
And to top it all, when I finally agree to set foot on his island and Sarah leaves me for dead, what does he do?
Maybe he didn't know...
Nothing! He did nothing!
If Gregory hadn't tended to me, I would have died that very night!
Oh, I can see he's keen to cozy up to you, but for his daughters, for me, not a gesture... Nothing!
Not even a word!
Listen, we're wasting our time, we are not going to vote for Mortimer, that's all there is to it!
The man is sly. He has no scruples at all, and I refuse to pass on any of my credibility to him.
Subject closed!
Right... this is not gonna be easy...
What could possibly make her change her mind?
Pretend that you'll leave her if she doesn't vote for Mortimer
I don't know where this is going to lead, but let's play along with her little game...
Look, you need to get a grip on yourself...
I refuse to oppose Father.
We shall vote in favor of Mortimer's project or I'll leave you.
No, Louis, that's enough!
I won't tolerate this kind of behavior!
You'd better get a grip on yourself this minute!
Let it go, tell her to go to hell!
Right, listen, that's enough, you're making no sense!
Forget it, I'll manage on my own.
And while I'm at it, forget you ever saw me. And I'll do likewise.
Pardon, Louis?
I want nothing more to do with you, am I making myself clear?
Stop it! I'm fed up with your tantrums!
Stop acting like a child!
Promise to have children with her
Emma, I really think that if we follow Father, we'll be able to do even bigger projects.
Imagine... You, me, our children, and Father, brought together by a common goal.
I... Our children?
Yes, our children.
Don't you want children?
Yes... yes! Of course I do!...
I didn't know you had even contemplated it, to be honest...
Play on the “family reunion”
I know it won't be easy for you, but my dream is to bring our family back together again.
Play on the children
I want our children to know their grandfather.
You can understand that, can't you?
Drop it, don't commit yourself!
Yes... yes! Of course I can!...
Even though it pains me, I must admit your dream is highly commendable.
Louis, I am touched. I didn't really think you believed in us...
Seriously... what insight...
Forgive me... I know I can come across as being a little abrupt at times.
But rest assured that my intentions are sincere.
Louis, that's wonderful... we are going to be so happy!
What on earth am I getting myself into here?...
As a sign of reconciliation, might you vote for Father's project... at the conference?
All right, Louis. He will have my vote...
Perfect!
You'll have to excuse me, I've some things to take care of. The preparations for the conference are terribly time-consuming and...
Of course, off you go, my love.
I shall think about where we should set up home.
I want a pretty estate where our children can grow up in complete safety, surrounded by the delights of nature...
Good, please do, madam.
I'll be going...
Promise to marry her
Emma, marry me!
You... wh... what... what did you just say?
Once all this is over, marry me!
Your husband is old, and he's at death's door! I know it's just a sham.
Once he's gone, marry me!
But... I thought... you were so closed off towards me....
I know, I can sometimes be surly and aloof, but please forgive me.
Yes.
Yes, you accept?
Yes!
I want to marry you!
Deliver the killing blow!
However, Madam... I have a request to make.
If you say yes, you'll make me the happiest man alive.
Go on, you can ask me, Louis.
I want us all to be reunited at our wedding.
Father included.
Use emotional blackmail
I can't get married without our father being there.
I beg you to forgive all of his sins...
Stop everything, this is going too far!
Louis, it's...
Madam...Emma...
Please. Give him another chance, I'm certain he'll take it!
What are you suggesting?
I don't know....
Vote for his project at the conference, for example?
It will show he can count on you and that we're all a real family, united!
Louis, I....
It's a lot to ask...
I know...
Alright.
You'll vote for his project?
Yes!
If it can bring us together, I'll do it. And he will give me his arm to walk up the aisle.
Thank you, madam!
I'll run along and tell Father.
I'll meet you later.
Yes, see you later, my love.
Dammit, what have I gotten myself into now?
Find her weakness
Emma, what happened to you?
Speak to me...
You just stop right there!
I'm not going to let you question me like this!
Assure her that Mortimer will grant her an estate
Madam, just think about what we might gain by following Father!
You just stop right there!
I don't know what's come over you but you're gonna have to pull yourself together right now!
Now leave me. You've given me a migraine and I'd like to be alone.
Right, just drop it, there's no hope for her...
Don't lose it, Louis. Leave what happened on the wharf behind and don't let yourself be overwhelmed by anger!
Concentrate on the conference... You are here only for the conference!
Now come on!...
Duchess?
Enter, Louis. You've timed your arrival perfectly, my dear friend.
I was about to come and see you.
Am I dreaming or is she making out that nothing happened...
Madam, I'm here for the conference. But I'd like to make it clear that I have not forgotten what happened on the wharf.
So I'd like to get straight to the point without wasting a second.
Louis, I was hoping...
Wrongly!
I'm only here because I wasn't given a choice.
I'd like to know which way you're going to vote.
I shall vote against Mortimer's project, of course.
Damn it...
No!
You will vote for!
I beg your pardon?
Yes, you are going to vote for and I'm going to tell you why!
What can make her change her mind?
Threaten her
You are going to vote for, otherwise once back on the continent, I shall hand you over to the authorities for the murder of my mother!
You don't have a choice, Madam, you'll do what I say!
My poor friend, you are off your game.
I understand your pain following Sarah's death, but you've got nothing on me.
And I don't know where you think you are going with this attempt to intimidate me, but I really must tell you that it's simply pathetic.
But I...
Shut up!
You have no power over me!
Make her think they've all changed sides
You are going to vote for Mortimer because it's in your interest to do so.
My god, whatever next?
How far will you go with this devotion toward Sir Gregory?
Don't bother trying, Louis. You won't convince me.
Even if I tell you that all the other guests have switched sides and that you're the last one?
You're bluffing...
You think so?
Wöllner would never go against Holm!
I admit it wasn't easy.
How the devil did you...
I'm here to warn you...
What do you think will happen if you're the only one against him?
Well... I...
I don't think he'll tolerate it, madame.
If you persist, you will be putting yourself in danger.
I can't believe it....
How is it possible?
So what should I tell him, then?
Will you be voting for him?
Of course.
How could it be otherwise...
Tell him that it will be a great honor for England to support him in such an extravagant venture.
Guarantee her Mortimer's victory.
Duchess, if you remain with Sir Gregory, you'll be losing everything.
Mortimer is on the verge of winning all the votes and if by misfortune you are the one who makes him lose this conference, frankly I would not like to be in your shoes.
Oh, Louis.
Seeing you try such trickery, you must be really desperate...
No... it... it's...
My poor friend... I'm sure that if you asked Sir Gregory, he would welcome you amongst us.
Seeing you like this just makes me so sad.
Mind reading
...
Wait, what ?
That's strange, I can't pick up any thoughts...
Well, it seems like we're finished here.
Is there something you wanted to speak to me about?
Emma?
Come in, Louis...
What can I do for you?
What with the conference soon upon us, I would have thought...
You are absolutely right!
I wanted to wait a bit before talking to you, but as you are here...
I've been thinking about what we shall do once we get back.
How to arrange the house, prepare the rooms for the children... Yes, I want three and the first one will be a boy.
We shall call him Louis, like his father.
Oh man, this just keeps getting worse...
She's drifting deeper into madness.
I ought to help her!
Right, I can't exactly leave her like this...
Let alone allow her to be manipulated for the sake of this cursed conference.
Mortimer has to help her!
Please excuse me, Madam.
Just remembered I've got something to do...
Come back quick, my love.
See you later, madam.
I must warn Mortimer that she can't go on like this. I'm sure he can help her.
Just too bad! She's got what she deserves!
It would almost be sad if she didn't totally deserve it!
She wanted to play and she lost! And I'm not going to save her!
Anyway, we'll have time to talk about it later.
Regarding the conference, as we are going to vote against Mortimer's project, I thought you ought to warn Sir Gregory.
No, wait...
I'm sure he'll reserve you a prime seat at his side.
No, you don't understand...
What do you mean?
I intend to vote for Mortimer
I came to see you precisely to let you know that I'll be voting in favor of Mortimer's project to sell Louisiana.
I beg your pardon?
And I wanted to fnd out if you would be willing to follow me...
With Mortimer?
You can't be serious, Louis!
Never will I follow him! Must I remind you he abandoned me when your mother tried to kill me!
[MANIPULATION] Persuade her to vote for Mortimer
Emma, I think it will better if we sided with Father.
I'm sure he will be very grateful to us.
Over my dead body!
I will never side with him! He might be my progenitor, but I refuse to follow him!
[PSYCHOLOGIE] What has she got against Mortimer?
Emma, I admit he's not perfect, but what exactly is your problem with Father?
My problem?!
He never cared about us! Open your eyes!
Take a look at the opulence around you! Don't you think our lives would have been better if he had given us just a second of his attention?
Emily and I grew up in the streets!
Yes, we made it out of there, but we've only got ourselves to thank!
I grew up dreaming of an imaginary family in the orphanage for young girls in Bloomsbury...
We were punished so often we were afraid to put a foot wrong... it was hell!  Hell, Louis!
Then, petty scams and tricks to pay for a miserable room where we had to spend half the night shooing away rats!
It took us ten long years before we managed to get into high society, ten years to get noticed by the queen.
And not once did he reach out to help us!
And to top it all, when I finally agree to set foot on his island and Sarah leaves me for dead, what does he do?
Maybe he didn't know...
Nothing! He did nothing!
If Gregory hadn't tended to me, I would have died that very night!
Oh I can see he's keen to cozy up to you, but for his daughters, for me, not a gesture... Nothing!
Not even a word!
Listen , we're wasting our time, we are not going to vote for  Mortimer, that's all there is to it!
The man is sly.  He has no scruples at all, and I refuse to pass on any of my credibility to him.
Subject closed!
Right... this is not going to be easy...
What could possibly make her change her mind?
Pretend that you'll leave her if she doesn't vote for Mortimer
I don't know where this is going to lead, but let's play along with her little game...
Look, you need to get a grip on yourself...
I refuse to oppose Father.
We shall vote in favor of Mortimer's project or I'll leave you.
Ah, Louis, that's enough!
I won't tolerate this kind of behavior!
You'd better get a grip on yourself this minute!
Let it go, tell her to go to hell!
Right, listen, that's enough, you're making no sense!
Forget it, I'll manage on my own.
And while I'm at it, forget you ever saw me. I'll do likewise.
Pardon, Louis?
I want nothing more to do with you, am I making myself clear?
That's enough! I'm fed up with your tantrums!
Stop acting like a child!
[CONVICTION] Promise to have children with her
Emma, I really think that if we follow Father we will be able to do even bigger projects.
Imagine... You, me, our children, and father, brought together by a common project.
I... Our children?
Yes, our children.
Don't you want children?
Yes... yes! Of course I do!...
I didn't know you had even contemplated it, to be honest...
Play on the “family reunion”
I know it won't be easy for you, but my dream is to bring our family back together.
Play on the children
I want our children to know their grandfather.
You can understand that, can't you?
Drop it, don't commit yourself!
Yes... yes! Of course I can!...
Even though it pains me, I must admit your dream is highly commendable.
Louis, I am touched. I didn't really think you believed in us...
Seriously... what insight...
Forgive me... I know I can come across as being a little abrupt at times.
But rest assured that my intentions are sincere.
Louis, that's wonderful... we are going to be so happy!
That's right... off we go...
What on earth am I getting myself into here?...
As a sign of reconciliation, might you vote for Father's project... at the conference?
All right, Louis. He will have my vote...
Perfect!
You'll have to excuse me, I've some things to take care of. The preparations for the conference are terribly time-consuming and...
Of course, off you go, my love.
I shall think about where we should set up home.
I want a pretty estate where our children can grow up in complete safety, surrounded by the delights of nature...
Good, please do, madam.
I'll be going...
[LOGIQUE] Promise to marry her
Emma, marry me!
You... wh... what did you just say?
Once all this is over, marry me!
Your husband is old, at death's door! I know it's just a sham.
Once he's gone, marry me!
But... I thought... you were so closed off toward me....
I know, I can sometimes be surly and aloof, please forgive me.
Yes.
Yes, you accept?
Yes!
I want to marry you!
Deliver the killing blow!
However, Madam... I've a request to make.
If you say yes, you'll make me the happiest man alive.
Go on, you can ask me, Louis.
I want us all to be reunited at our wedding.
Father included.
Use emotional blackmail
I can't get married without our father being there.
I beg you to forgive all his sins...
Stop everything, this is going too far!
Louis, it's...
Madam...
Please. Give him another chance, I am certain he'll take it!
What are you suggesting?
I don't know....
Vote for his project at the conference, for example?
It will show he can count on you and that we are a real family, united!
Louis, I....
It's a lot to ask...
I know...
Alright.
You'll vote for his project?
Yes!
If it can bring us together, I'll do it. And he will give me his arm to walk up the aisle.
Thank you, madam!
I'll run along to tell Father.
I'll meet you later.
Yes, see you later, my love.
Dammit, what have I gotten myself into now?
[INTERROGATOIRE] Find her weakness
Emma, what happened to you?
Speak to me...
You just stop right there!
I'm not going to let you question me like this!
Assure her that Mortimer will grant her an estate
Madam, just think about what we might gain by following Father!
You just stop right there!
I don't know what's come over you but you're going to have to pull yourself together right now!
Now leave me. You've given me a migraine and I'd like to be alone.
Right, just drop it, there's no hope for her...
Don't lose it, Louis. Leave what happened on the wharf behind and don't let yourself be overwhelmed by anger!
Concentrate on the conference... You are here only for the conference!
Come on!...
Duchess?
Enter, Louis. You've timed your arrival perfectly, my dear friend.
I was about to come and see you.
Am I dreaming or is she making out that nothing happened...
Madam, I am here for the conference. But I would like to make it clear that I have not forgotten what happened on the wharf.
So I would like to get straight to the point without wasting a second.
Louis, I was hoping...
Wrongly!
I'm only here now because I wasn't given any choice.
I would like to know which way you'll go for the vote.
I shall vote against Mortimer's project, of course.
Darn it...
No!
You will vote for!
I beg your pardon?
Yes, you are going to vote for and I'm going to tell you why!
What can make her change her mind?
Threaten her
You are going to vote for, otherwise once back on the continent, I shall hand you over to the authorities for the murder of Sarah de Richet!
You are aware that she's Sir Gregory's guest.
My poor friend, you are off your game.
I understand your pain following Sarah's death, but you've got nothing on me.
And I don't know where you think you are going with this attempt to intimidate me, but I really must tell you that it's simply pathetic.
But... I...
Shut up!
You have no power over me!
Make her think they've all changed sides
You are going to vote for Mortimer because it's in your interest to do so.
My god, whatever next?
How far will you go with your devotion toward Sir Gregory?
Don't bother trying, Louis. You won't convince me.
Even if I tell you that all the guests have turned and that you're the last one?
You're bluffing...
You think so?
Wöllner would never go against Holm!
I admit it wasn't easy.
How the devil did you...
I'm only here to warn you...
What do you think will happen to you if you're the only one against him?
Well... I...
I don't think he will tolerate it, madame.
If you persist, you will  be putting yourself in danger.
I can't believe it....
How is it possible?
What should I tell him, then?
Will you be voting for him?
Of course.
How could it be otherwise...
Tell him that it will be a great honor for England to support him in such an extravagant venture.
Guarantee him Mortimer's victory.
Duchess, if you remain with Sir Gregory, you will lose everything.
Mortimer is on verge of winning all the votes and if by misfortune you are the one who makes him lose this conference, frankly I would not like to be in your shoes.
Oh, Louis.
Seeing you try such trickery, you must be really desperate...
No... it's...
My poor friend... I am sure that if you asked Sir Gregory, he would welcome you among us.
Seeing you like this just makes me so sad.
Mind reading
...
Hey...
That's strange, I can't pick up any thoughts...
Well, it seems like we're finished here.
Is there something you wanted to speak to me about?
I have some something important to tell you.
And please try to keep calm.
I want you to know the truth because I see you here among us drowning in total ignorance and it sincerely makes me sad.
What on earth are you talking about?
Oh, Louis, please don't start shouting!
Very well, Emily.
Very well, Emma.
Sorry for losing my temper.
What did you want to speak to me about?
Ah, that's more like it. Well...
Well... I...
What I wanted to tell you is...
Yes?
That you might...
What?
That you made a mistake here when you believed I was Emily.
What... You...
I am Emma, Louis.
And that's not all.
I'm Mortimer's daughter as well.
So we are brother and sister
Wh... But...
I'm also a Daemon.
There, now you know everything...brother.
I feel better. I didn't want there to be any lies between us.
How do you feel? Are you alright?
I was worried you'd take it the wrong way...
Nooo! No, of course not...
Good, I'm glad.
You understand, if we are to move forward together, we have to be able to trust one another.
Move forward?
Yes, once we're together.
I've been thinking about it, you know. Once we get back, we won't have to wait long before my poor husband passes...
Then we'll be able to get married.
Get married?...
Oh, Louis, I've been thinking of nothing else!
My sister would never have made you happy, you know! Not like I can!
Stay in control, Louis! Keep calm!
Keep concentrated, Louis!
Don't give anything away!
CON-CEN-TRATE!
Yes, of course.
Isn't it wonderful? We'll all be together, as a family!
Alright...
Oh man.  I am completely out of my depth here...
I see you've thought of everything.
It's the right thing to do!
See you in a while.
The poor woman is literally broken inside...
I might not hold her in my heart, but I wouldn't wish this on anyone.
FILTHY BITCH!!
You are sick!!!
You lunatic! You killed your own sister!!
You killed my mother!!
You deserve to end up on the gallows!
That's enough!!
I won't tolerate another word!
OUT!
If you think I'm going to let you get away with this... behavior, then you don't know me at all!
Pull yourself together if you want me to ever forgive you!
Duke Manuel.
De Richet.
I'm delighted to see you're standing by Lord Mortimer.
One cannot say that the situation is altogether reassuring but I must admit, he does know what he's doing.
Something tells me I've made the right choice.
So, to thank you for persuading me to join you, what would you say to a nice piece of Amber?
I am given to understand that you collect it?
Yes, thank you very much, sir.
Don't mention it, Louis, it is the least I can do.
Good, see you at the vote.
I'll see you later then.
Right, Godoy is on board!
Duke Manuel ?
De Richet ? I'm surprised you dare speak to me.
Come now, my Lord Duke...
I hope Sir Gregory will make you sorry for betraying him.
In politics, one must know how to play the ball on the bounce.
Duke Manuel.
De Richet.
Let me guess. How fortunate it is that I'm here because you wanted to speak to me?
You read me like a book, sir.
Sir Gregory warned us that someone from Lord Mortimer's group would come and try to persuade us to change sides.
I did not think that you would dare volunteer, given your previous ineffectiveness...
Your last attempt triggered a war between our countries, need I remind you!
Anyway, it must be said that you certainly have steel in your veins!
This might be hard for you to believe, but things have changed.
What are you implying?
[MIND READING]
He looks very sure of himself.
I wonder what he's got planned...
String him along using his curiosity
I've simply found out more...
About what?
About the project, and also about the parties present.
It was enough to convince me...
I... Alright.
What have you found then?
When you find out, you'll hasten to join us.
Right! Well, you have piqued my curiosity, de Richet...
Mortimer intends to come to an agreement with the King directly...
It turns out that you're about to lose everything.
Is that all?!
I've been given to understand that Lord Mortimer was going around you by dealing directly with the King.
If you don't join him as soon as possible, you will be deposed by your own sovereign!
Louis, not only will you realize that I am the head of the government, but you'll come to learn it's not the King who needs cajoling..
What do you mean exactly?
Behind every great man, there is a great woman.
Unfortunately for you, the place is already taken. I've already taken care of it.
So I advise you to warn Mortimer to change strategies.
Even so, something is wrong...
Flatter him
Well, it would indeed be an honor if you'd allow me a moment to persuade you in turn...
A powerful man like yourself cannot...
De Richet, stop playing your little games with me.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
I just wanted to...
Be agreeable to me, I suppose... well, I am not impressed.
England will follow Mortimer thanks to the Duchess
It turns out that England is going to follow Mortimer.
Are you joking? The Duchess has no interest in persuading the Queen to follow France.
No, Emily has no interest in following France.
On the other hand, she will have an interest in following her father.
What?! The Duchess is Mortimer's daughter!
That's right.
Good Lord, he has taken us all for a ride!
The worm has been in the fruit since the very beginning!
Do you have anymore information like this?
I have a funny feeling you're hiding something from me!
Why exactly did you choose to follow Lord Mortimer?
[MIND READING]
Mortimer has a plan... I knew it!
He must have persuaded the others, which means, I'm the last one...
Because Mortimer is my Father
Lord Mortimer is my Father.
What?
You too! Good heavens, this is becoming a family affair in the worst possible sense.
Listen, Louis, don't take it the wrong way but you have no real political power.
Following your father simply because he's your progenitor is the worst thing you could do!
Yes, but that's not all there is to it...
It's all very moving of course, but your political career is going to be short if you let your affections govern your choices.
If you have no other arguments, you'll understand that I shall not be following you this time round.
Holm knows he's going to lose
I have no faith in Sir Gregory.
Indeed! And why is that?
I don't know, he acts like someone who knows they've already lost.
Of course!
Given Mortimer's team, honestly didn't you have any doubts about your winning?
Sorry, not for one second.
Pretend that everything was planned
No need to apologize, Lord Mortimer planned everything to make you believe it.
What do you...
Everything is going exactly to his plan.
And how is Holm taking it?
So, I expect Sir Gregory is reassured...
I... no.
Oh, and why would that be?
He is worried. He thinks Lord Mortimer is planning something.
It all seems too easy to him, doesn't it?
Yes, but I'm sure Sir Gregory's concern is not justified.
Or rather he knows he's already lost.
But...
Not once has Lord Mortimer been the least bit worried.
Not once has he wavered, never has he had the slightest doubt.
And do you know the reason for such confidence?
No. I didn't need to ask whether or not to join Mortimer.
He acts like a winner. He knows he's going to win. The game is over.
And Holm knows it as well.
But where did we go wrong then?
Louis! Tell me! Where did we go wrong?
They're all going to vote for Mortimer, Manuel.
But... No! That is impossible!
Will you be the only one to raise a hand in favor of Sir Gregory?
I... But...
The one to whom everything happens... who reaps all the consequences.
No! I cannot afford to lose!
FOR SPAIN!
You are on your own
You're the only one left, my Lord Duke.
They'll all have turned away.
If you don't follow Mortimer, he'll never let you get away with it.
Even if you vote against at the conference and you save Sir Gregory's skin, what will happen to you afterward?
Sir Gregory will protect me! As he has always done!
Without any allies?
He will no longer be your protector, you will be his.
You against all the countries of Europe.
NO! I refuse to jeopardize my country!
Yet, that's precisely what you're doing.
Holm is about to bring you down with him.
He does a good job at hiding it, but that is exactly what is happening.
Holm couldn't care less about Spain
You really shouldn't trust Holm!
Look at him! He's playing at a lot of different tables and you're clearly not his priority.
That is ridiculous, really!
He's allied to England!
Come on, you're not saying that Spain holds England in its heart, are you ?
You never stop fighting each other for control of the seas!
Monsieur de Richet, if I may offer you a word of advice, leave politics to those who do it professionally.
Now, have we gone through all your arguments?
GOOD OUTCOME
I... I do not want Spain to pay the price of an alliance made too hastily!
Not because of me!
Indeed, it would seem things have changed! Thank you for letting me know, Louis.
May I call you Louis?
Of course you can, Manuel.
In fact, to be perfectly honest, I... I never really made up my mind...
Naturally.
I... Yes...
D... do you think Lord Mortimer will tell me a little more about this, if I pop in to see him?
What is more normal than wanting to get informed before you make a decision.
Yes, I won!
Look at him, squirming on the end of the hook so as not to lose face...I love it.
Of course, he'd be delighted.
Perfect, it's a deal.
You can count on me at the conference, Louis!
Marvelous!
If you don't mind I'll be leaving you now, I'll go straight to Mortimer to tell him the good news.
Yes! Yes, please do, go ahead, Louis!
BAD OUTCOME
No, really, is that all you have?
Right, let us save time and stop this charade, Louis.
In all friendship, I must say, this conference has allowed you to learn from the very best...
But you're going too fast, in my opinion.
Damnit! No good, I haven't persuaded him...
You ought to grant me one more minute...
That's enough, Louis.
I have already stretched Sir Gregory's recommendations by granting you these few minutes, enough is enough.
I bid you good luck...I bid you good evening...
And may the best man win!
... Yes, we shall see...
Well played, Louis! A this rate, Louisiana is likely to remain Spanish forever!
Right, let's use this opportunity to get inside Godoy, I've got a few things I'd like to say to Mr von Wöllner!
Just one moment, my Lord Duke.
Yes, Monsieur?
Is there something you wanted to add?
Concentrate...
I need you to listen carefully to what I have to say, Godoy.
I am all ears.
Louis, push!
I need you to do me a little favor...
It's working, that's it, Louis! Get in his head!
Oh dear... what is happening to me, I... I do not feel very well...
I need your help, sir.
Get in his head!
Perfect...
Thank you, monsieur.
I'm sure I'll know how to take full advantage of your vessel... Now that I... am Manuel!
Duke Manuel.
De Richet.
I'm delighted to see you're standing by Lord Mortimer.
One cannot say that the situation is altogether reassuring but I must admit, he does know what he's doing.
Something tells me I've made the right choice.

If you don't follow Mortimer, he'll never let you get away with it.
Even if you vote against at the conference and you save Sir Gregory's skin, what will happen to you afterward?
Sir Gregory will protect me! As he has always done!
Without any allies?
He will no longer be your protector, you will be his.
You against all the countries of Europe.
NO! I refuse to jeopardize my country!
Yet, that's precisely what you're doing.
Holm is about to bring you down with him.
He does a good job at hiding it, but that is exactly what is happening.
[POLITIQUE] Holm couldn't care less about Spain
You really shouldn't trust Holm!
Look at him! He's playing at a lot of different tables and you're clearly not his priority.
That is ridiculous, really!
He's allied to England!
Come on, you're not saying that Spain holds England in its heart, are you ?
You never stop fighting each other for control of the seas!
Monsieur de Richet, if I may offer you a word of advice, leave politics to those who do it professionally.
Now, have we gone through all your arguments?
GOOD OUTCOME
I... I do not want Spain to pay the price of an alliance made too hastily!
Not because of me!
Indeed, it would seem things have changed! Thank you for letting me know, Louis.
May I call you Louis?
Of course you can, Manuel.
In fact, to be perfectly honest, I... I never really made up my mind...
Naturally.
I... Yes...
D... do you think Lord Mortimer will tell me a little more about this, if I pop in to see him?
What is more normal than wanting to get informed before you make a decision.
Yes, I won!
Look at him, squirming on the end of the hook so as not to lose face...I love it.
Of course, he'd be delighted.
Perfect, it's a deal.
You can count on me at the conference, Louis!
Marvelous!
If you don't mind I'll be leaving you now, I'll go straight to Mortimer to tell him the good news.
Yes! Yes, please do, go ahead, Louis!
BAD OUTCOME
No, really, is that all you have?
Right, let us save time and stop this charade, Louis.
In all friendship, I must say, this conference has allowed you to learn from the very best...
But you're going too fast, in my opinion.
Damnit! No good, I haven't persuaded him...
You ought to grant me one more minute...
That's enough, Louis.
I have already stretched Sir Gregory's recommendations by granting you these few minutes, enough is enough.
I bid you good luck...I bid you good evening...
And may the best man win!
... Yes, we shall see...
Well played, Louis! A this rate, Louisiana is likely to remain Spanish forever!
I have already stretched Sir Gregory's recommendations by granting you these few minutes, enough is enough.
Right, let's use this opportunity to get inside Godoy, I've got a few things I'd like to say to Mr von Wöllner!
Just one moment, my Lord Duke.
Yes, Monsieur?
Is there something you wanted to add?
Concentrate...
I need you to listen carefully to what I have to say, Godoy.
I am all ears.
Louis, push!
I need you to do me a little favor...
It's working, that's it, Louis! Get in his head!
Oh dear... what is happening to me, I... I do not feel very well...
I need your help, sir.
Get in his head!
Perfect...
Thank you, monsieur.
I'm sure I'll know how to take full advantage of your vessel... Now that I... am Manuel!
Good, I mustn't lose too much time...
See you later, my Lord Duke... Have a nice rest.
Good, I mustn't lose too much time...
See you later, my Lord Duke... Have a nice rest.
De Richet! I told you that I did not have time for you, I will ask you to leave me alone.
Dear friends, I'd like to thank you for your continued trust and confidence.
I admit that during these past few days there has been much upheaval.
I understand you have all been affected by this.
Nevertheless, the world doesn't stop turning, and we are in fact on the verge of reshaping the modern world.
That is what we are all here for, my Lord!
Thank you for your enthusiasm, Monsieur Bonaparte.
Now you all know what we have to do.
I cannot warn you strongly enough: if one of Sir Gregory's guests asks to speak with you, remain on your guard!
It is highly likely that he will try to rally as many supporters to his cause as he can.
Don't worry, William.
We are all here to support your project through to its conclusion.
Thank you, George.
Now, please, go and get some rest before the conference begins.
Which won't be long now.
Louis, stay with me a moment, won't you?
I'll be needing your services, in a certain matter...
Yes, of course! What's the matter?
Louis, you are the only one here who I totally trust.
It is very likely that Gregory will take possession of some of the members of our team.
I shall keep them in check over the next few hours.
However, I'll need you to... how can I say this... to persuade the members of Gregory's group.
What do you mean by that exactly?
You'll have free rein, my son.
Persuade all of them! Use every possible means imaginable! But no physical violence, let's be very very clear about that!
You must bring them all over to our side! One after the other!
What if I can't?
And what if I fail?
I have faith in you, my son. Great faith.
That notwithstanding, should any of them resist, we'll decide what to do afterwards.
Let him finish
You can do this! I know it!
Very well, Father.
Now go, and come back and see me once you've finished!
I'll be off then.
Louis, there you are...
Well? Tell me, how did it go?
I did my best.
Whom did you manage to persuade?
Father, before we start, I've a favor to ask of you.
Do you really think this is the right time to ask?
Yes, it might give you the impression that I'm forcing you but...
I'm listening.
It's about Emma.
Help her, please.
What do you mean?
She's in a bad way, Father.
She's your daughter. We need to get her off the island as soon as possible.
Her state of health concerns me greatly and she needs to be cared for.
She's losing her mind.
You are aware that she's Sir Gregory's guest, not mine.
I'm not the only one who decides these things.
I'm sure you can persuade him.
Alright, I'll have a word with him.
Now, tell me who you've managed to bring over to us?
I have some bad news, Father.
I'm listening.
None of them agreed to join us.
They all...
What?! What on earth happened?!
Well, either they aren't convinced by the project, or they think it's a lost cause.
But you had the means to persuade them, Louis.
How could you have failed me like this?!
I'm sorry.
I should never have let you handle it.
I had too much faith in you, I was blind, you weren't ready...
What an imbecile I am!
Don't blame yourself...
Leave me, please Louis. I have to think the situation through.
But I...
Louis!...Go !
Very well, I'll let you be.
Well, there's no point in wasting any time. I'm proud to report they've all come over to our side.
Ha, ha, Louis, I'm impressed!
I was sure you would succeed!
I'm proud of you, my son!
Even Johann!
How did you manage to do it?
Tell him how you did it
I possessed Godoy...
You possessed Godoy... Of course!
Very ingenious of you, I must say!
Evade
A magician never reveals his tricks.
Hahaha! And right you are!
And you should be proud. You've earned that right!
Son, you've accomplished a veritable tour de force...
I couldn't have done better myself!
Now, we are ready! The conference may begin!
Piaggi
You can count on Cardinal Piaggi.
Ah, perfect.
I had a feeling old Giuseppe would be able to follow me.
Godoy
You can count on Duke Manuel's vote.
Now I am impressed.
I would never have thought the duke would have yielded.
I see you must have been very persuasive.
Wollner
You can count on Mr von Wöllner.
Really?
Well, I must admit I'm stunned at your success there.
I truly believed he would never betray Gregory.
Duchess Hillsborrow.
The duchess will follow us.
She will? Marvelous.
Why didn't he tell me she was his daughter?
But why didn't you tell me we were brother and sister?
Now Louis, don't blame me.
I thought, as you were going through a very difficult time, that you had enough on your plate without having to cope with having a new sister.
Otherwise, you can be sure I would have told you sooner.
Say nothing
The thing is, Emma has become deranged since the death of her sister...
I thought... in short, she thinks we're going to get married and...
I'll take care of her. It's the after-effects which I think are only to be expected. I'll go and see her, rest assured.
Thank you, Father.
Washington
President Washington is going to side with you after all.
Ah! I was sure that was all a misunderstanding.
Very good.
I see. So we are going to lose the vote...
Father, I'm sorry... I...
No, I should never have let you handle it!
It's my fault!
I thought you would be able to accomplish this tour de force but clearly you weren't ready!
What an idiot I've been!
Apologize
I'd like to apologi...
And, for crying out loud, stop apologizing!
You are my son! You never apologize! Not even to me.
Say nothing
...
Never mind... let's forget the conference!
Now, I have to prepare for what's coming next.
Louis, leave me, if you will.
Listen, Louis, congratulations for what you've just accomplished.
It's not perfect but it's still quite a feat.
But not enough, given that the vote must be approved unanimously.
We're going to lose...
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
If it's just one vote I can take care of it, even if Gregory is doing all he can to distract me.
You'll take care of it?
Yes, we're not going to lose over just one vote.
I couldn't have been any more persuasive myself. You've done the hardest part, I'll take over now, don't worry.
Assemble everyone in the conference room.
Yes, sir.
Meet me there, and let's get it over with.
So, go and take care of your mission, and come back and see me once you've accomplished it, Louis.
Your Eminence, would you have a moment?
I shouldn't really, Louis... As you can imagine.
Rest assured, I come just as a friend.
Alright then, Louis, but be quick.
Thank you, your Eminence.
No matter how I look at it, between my affection for you and the conference...
I can't hide my disappointment at your changing sides, Louis.
With all due respect to Lord Mortimer, how could you follow him like this?
I understand your disappointment, your Eminence, but I have good reason to.
Ah! It's got nothing to do with it but...
You... You didn't come and see me in my room a few hours ago, did you?
Hmm... does he remember anything?
Er... Oh, no. No, I'm sorry.
You must be mistaken, I've been speaking to Lord Mortimer in his study.
I... I must have dreamed it then...
It seemed so real.
Don't blame yourself, your Eminence, we're all exhausted, I can assure you of that.
That's very kind of you, Louis.
I don't know what's wrong with me at the moment, but I feel rather fragile.
Poor man seems terrified. It'd be a good idea if I reassured him a little, before trying to get him to change sides.
What did you want from me exactly?
(MIND READING) Read Piaggi's mind
It was so real...
I... I don't understand it.
Oh Lord, are you going to test me again?
God be with you
Your Eminence, don't worry over such small matters.
God sees you and knows the value of his servants.
Thank you, my son.
You've worked all your life to spread the good word.
Don't worry, your Eminence.
I'm sure you'll find the answer to your dreams. God is with you and he will show you what you need to know.
You are right, Louis.
Thank you for your kind words.
What does he remember exactly?
If you don't mind me asking... What did you dream of, your Eminence?
It's rather confusing, Louis.
You were here... as well as Mr von Wöllner...
But no... it's... it's impossible!
What is it?
No, no, nothing!
It couldn't have happened. I don't understand, Lord!
What's happening to me?
Calm down, your Eminence. Everything is all right, I'm here for you.
I didn't think that just talking about his dreams would affect him like this.
NO! It's not possible! Lord, help me!
Does he know about oneiromancy?
Tell me, your Eminence, have you ever been interested in oneiromancy?
The interpretation on dreams, Louis?
Well, I can't lend any credence to that sort of superstition. It's not serious, Louis.
Yet, there was a time when it was said that manifestations were revealed to the Prophets through their dreams.
The God of Israel says: "Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the ideas that come to you in dreams"!
Louis, it's been quite some time since we learned to be wary of this kind of interpretation.
Alright, then. My mistake...
Speak about his dream
Tell me, your Eminence, do you know anything about symbols in dreams?
Come, Louis, the scriptural Law rejects all divination through dreams! You ought to know that.
Of course, I... I wasn't suggesting that these visions were messages from God, your Eminence.
But it might be that when we rest, our mind imagines situations based on things that left an impression on it.
Take your dream, for example. What did it speak of?
I'm not sure that I can speak about it...
Don't worry, your Eminence. There's no one else here but me.
Well, I was right here, in my room, and you came to see me.
Then it all became confusing... I know that Mr von Wöllner was here too.
He... no, no, it's not possible.
What was he doing?
He... tried to harm you.
Damn it, he does have memories of what happened...
Your Eminence, you have no reason to worry. Because I'm right here in front of you, in perfect health.
Yes... yes, you are right.
You're probably just a little tired. Overworked, that's all.
That's it, just a bit tired.
Anyway, thank you for listening.
Advise him to get some rest
Your Eminence, maybe you ought to get some rest. You look exhausted.
Out of the question, Louis.
I haven't come here to rest and my obligations come before my personal needs.
Please excuse me, Louis, if I've wasted your time.
You came to see me about the conference, I imagine, and here I go rambling on about I don't know what nonsense.
No need to apologize, your Eminence. Think nothing of it.
What did you want to speak to me about?
Right... it's now or never to get him to change his mind!
(MIND READING) Read Piaggi's mind
Dear Lord, don't abandon me!
I am your humble servant, show me the way...
Make him feel guilty
I must admit that opposing you pains me.
And it pains Lord Mortimer a great deal as well.
I can well imagine... You should know that I'm not happy about it either.
He's an upright man, who like yourself, spends his time helping others and doing good around him...
But you know that better than I do...
I owe him a lot, you know.
Your Eminence, if you feel you owe him something, let me tell you it's not too late to show it.
It's thanks to him that I took the holy orders. We met when I was very young, here, on this island.
After our encounter, I had the firm conviction that my duty was to take the holy orders.
To tell you the truth, I owe him everything.
Have you ever thanked him for it?
Never...
You must find me ungrateful.
I would never dare, your Eminence.
You came to persuade me to join him, didn't you?
I don't have that power, but I do sincerely believe that Lord Mortimer serves a righteous cause.
You are an angel who brings peace to the soul, my son...
Listen to your heart, your Eminence.
You are right. To hell with all this political manipulation.
Show him the way
Your Eminence, trust me.
I have faith in Lord Mortimer.
Let me show you the way and...
What did you say?
That I have faith in Lord Mortimer?
No, after!
Show you the way?
Yes, Louis!
You must show me the way!
Guide me into the light...
Yes, yes your Eminence, come with me into the light!
He's got the wrong side
Your Eminence, the... the truth is I have come to persuade you that following Sir Gregory is a serious mistake...
Louis, I'll stop you right there.
I'm tired of all these political conspiracies. If that is the only reason for your visit, then I'd rather we stop this discussion right away.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
His dream was a premonition
I can't help thinking about that dream you had.
When Von Wöllner tried to harm me, what did you do?
I... I interposed.
You came to my rescue?
Yes...
Well, don't you think there might be a kind of message in that?
A kind of oracle?
Louis, we shouldn't try to find a divine meaning in a dream such as this?
But is that possible?
Of course, in absolute terms, it can indeed be.
That God would... ask me to protect you ?
Well, we can't be certain, but we have to admit that, that could be the truth.
Can you imagine what it would mean?
I... If God gave me a sign...
I can't ignore it....
GOOD OUTCOME
I... Yes!
I must listen to my conscience...
Yes, listen to that little voice in your head.
What does it say?
Yes, Louis.
I will vote for William's project. I will follow you.
I'm sure it will mean a great deal to Lord Mortimer, your Eminence.
Once again, thank you, my son.
Please leave me now. I must pray.
Of course, your Eminence, I'll be on my way now.
BAD OUTCOME
Don't take this the wrong way, Louis, but I would like to be on my own just now....
As I already said, I shouldn't even have opened the door to you...
And I'm exhausted.
I won't change my vote for the conference, I'm sorry for you.
I... Yes, I'm sorry.
Please excuse me, I... I didn't mean to bother you.
I'll be on my way now.
Dammit! I'll have to tell Mortimer that I didn't manage to convince Piaggi!
Please leave me now, Louis, thank you.
Your Eminence, would you have a moment?
I shouldn't really, Louis... As you can imagine.
Rest assured, I've come just as a friend, I assure you.
Alright then, Louis, but be quick
Thank you, your Eminence.
No matter how I look at it, between my affection for you and the conference...
I can't hide my disappointment at your changing sides, Louis.
With all due respect to Lord Mortimer, how could you follow him like this?

What did you want from me exactly?

Oh Lord, are you going to try me again?
God be with you
You Eminence, don't worry over such a small matter.
God sees you and knows the value of his servants.
Thank you, my son.
You have worked all your life, to spread the good word.
Don't worry, your Eminence.
I'm sure you'll find the answer to your dreams. God is with you and he will show you what you need to know.

I have faith in Lord Mortimer.
Let me show you the way and...
What did you say?
That I have faith in Lord Mortimer?
No, after!
Let me show you the way?
Yes, Louis!
You must show me the way!

BAD OUTCOME
Don't take it the wrong way, Louis, but I would like to be on my own just now....
As I already said, I shouldn't even have opened the door to you...
And I'm exhausted.
I won't change my vote for the conference, I'm sorry for you.
I... Yes, excuse me.
Please excuse me, I didn't want to embarrass you.
I'll be off.
Dammit! I'll have to tell Mortimer that I didn't manage to bring Piaggi over!
Mr President, I was looking for you...
Well, and I you, would you believe it!
What on earth are you up to now?
You make me change my mind for the vote of the conference and then you proceed to change sides yourself?!
Yes, I... I do understand you being surprised.
I'm sorry but there have been new developments since then.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who was right
In fact, you were right.
I've been thinking about it since our discussion..
And I've been able to talk to the other guests.
You should have listened to me, you young fool!
You were absolutely right.
Please accept my humblest apologies, sir.
Alright, alright. I have my share of responsibility too.
After all, I didn't have to listen to you.
Sarah passed on her choice to me
I'm only representing the Golden Order, and replacing my mother.
I... I admit, I had cold feet about it but I must respect her choice above all...
That is precisely what I tried to tell you, Louis!
Sarah backed Lord Mortimer's project right from the start!
Yes, I remember it well...
Well, all right... Try to listen and have more faith in me next time, won't you?
My experience might be useful to you!
Mortimer persuaded me in the end
Honestly, it took me many hours of discussion with Lord Mortimer, Monsieur Bonaparte, and others, for me to get the big picture.
All the same, you might have told me!
I'm sorry, I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
At first, I was just trying to find arguments against them... but the image of an American nation, hand in hand with France...
Yes... alright fine, let's move on.
Listen... I must apologize once again...
But it's not too late.
Louis, listen, this is the last time you'll be dragging me into any such schemes.
You realize you are playing with the destinies of nations!
For goodness sake, grow up young man!
You're right, Mr President.
I cannot apologize enough.
Please, come back to us.
Of course I shall come back.
But from now on, please keep me out of your shenanigans!
I promise, Mr President.
And try to stick with one opinion, at least until the vote.
You have my word.
Good. Now leave me, I have work to do.
What brings you here, Mr President?
My Lord Duke... My apologies for being late...
What? A Frenchman who apologizes?
Decidedly, my stay here has never ceased to uncover surprises...
So? Have you any more information about de Richet?
What do you mean?
Are you joking? We agreed you would check to see if de Richet really has changed sides!
Oh, that, yes indeed, it appears that he's been brought over to Sir Gregory's side.
The traitor! He pushed me into turning against Sir Gregory to finally follow him himself!
It's a fiasco...
There are fewer of us than on the first vote!
How do you expect to win all the votes? It's getting worse and worse!
Dammit, we are ruined!
Don't you think Lord Mortimer has a last minute plan?
I think he's pretending to have a plan, just to save face, but really the game is over!
He will never be able to persuade all of Holm's supporters!
He must have found out something
If you want my opinion, he must be hiding something!
The villain! I was hoping he was just absent or busy snooping around all over the place in search of his mother!
No, it would seem he really has joined Sir Gregory.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I know what you mean!
I wager he knows Mortimer is going to lose the vote!
Don't you think we ought to think about ourselves and make sure we don't end up on the wrong side?
What? You would be prepared to leave Mortimer as well?
What do you say?
I refuse to be made a laughing stock!
The Golden Order has dropped Mortimer
De Richet has dropped us! It's time we moved on!
The Golden Order has turned against us!
You are too impulsive, Napoleon
There is still President Washington.
But it won't take much for him to turn too!
No, I do not see Washington leaving Mortimer.
No... I am not convinced, sorry.
Don't you have any more information?
If that is the case, I am voting for Holm as well!
I think you're right, my Lord Duke!
After all, Sir Gregory was my first choice...
Exactly...
But until then, not a word to anyone for safety's sake, I think it's preferable!
Yes, you're right!
And we'd better not stay together, someone might see us.
Good luck, my Lord Duke!
Likewise!
Ah! There you are at last, Bonaparte!
My Lord Duke...
What a typically French attitude!
Come, let's not...
You are twenty minutes late, without the least excuse...
I am risking a lot, monsieur, you seem to forget!
Er... Please excuse me.
Well?
What did you want to see me about?
So, let's see whose side he's really on...
I wanted to be sure. You are still going to vote for Mortimer as planned ? Yes ?
Mortimer?? What the devil are you talking about, Bonaparte?
I am on Holm's side and I intend to vote against Mortimer's project.
[MIND READING]
What on earth is wrong with him?
He seems very odd...
I know you are working for Mortimer
Come, now, my Lord Duke, you can't fool me.
We both know that you will follow Lord Mortimer when it comes to the vote.
My young friend, I do not know what's wrong with you but you are out of your mind.
I came here upon Sir Gregory's invitation and I intend to bury this ludicrous idea of selling Louisiana.
Louis De Richet told me
Yet that is what de Richet claims.
De Richet?
But... I... I do not understand, what does he have to do with it?
This is insane! You mean de Richet is spreading this rumor about me?
Indeed
That's right. Apparently you're some sort of double agent, if you will forgive me.
But he's mad, my word!
If Holm gets wind of it I will be a dead man!
The imbecile is going to get me into serious trouble!
Well, well. It seems my Lord Duke is panicking...
But let me assure you, no one believes a single word of what he says.
Are you sure?
Frankly, has anyone taken him seriously since he arrived?
Yes, you're right...
No, not at all
No, no. It's what I was given to believe while in conversation with him.
Ah, well that is good to know...
Of course, I get on well with Lord Mortimer but I don't want people thinking I'm playing on both sides of the fence.
You must have misunderstood, that is all.
Of course, you're probably right.
You can't fool me
My Lord Duke, I never once dreamed of you playing on both sides of the fence but I was given to understand that you and Lord Mortimer do have a few interests in common.
But... I...
I don't know what on earth you are talking about.
Lord Mortimer and myself may agree on a number of subjects but I am and shall always remain loyal to Sir Gregory.
You see, there is no reason to think that I could ever side with Mortimer.
Oh! That's a pity, he was going to make you an offer...
What are you talking about?
Make yourself clear, I do not understand you.
[MINDREADING]
This doesn't seem like the way Mortimer normally proceeds.
I'll know if he's lying or not by what he has to offer!
Offer him 50 000 Louis d'or.
Well, Lord Mortimer was willing to offer you a small fortune as compensation for the risks involved.
He wants to buy me?
What kind of a man does he take me for?
Damn it, this doesn't seem to be the right approach...
Please excuse me, I must have misunderstood.
I hope so, because I am not the kind of man to be tempted by any sum of money, monsieur, no matter how generous!
His gratitude
Well, if you supported Lord Mortimer in his project, he would be extremely grateful.
And we both know what it means when Lord Mortimer has a particular fondness for someone.
I... Monsieur Bonaparte, I do not know what to say.
Thank Lord Mortimer for his offer.
Bonaparte, you surprise me. I fail to understand where you are going with this.
You know very well
Come on, my Lord Duke.
We both know very well what we are talking about.
I thank you for not wasting my time.
I never dreamed of it, monsieur.
I have a fair idea as to your presence here but for some reason... something doesn't seem quite right...
Propose an alliance with France
You see, Lord Mortimer had intended you to form an alliance with France very shortly and...
I shall stop you right there!
Form an alliance with you? Are you serious?
Listen, Bonaparte, with all due respect I do not think you realize what you are saying.
I would never form an alliance with France.
To tell the truth, even if by I-don't-know-what magic spell I changed sides and followed Lord Mortimer in his folly, I still would not form an alliance with France!
That makes it clear, at least.
I... I am somewhat lost, to tell the truth. And this just isn't like you.
I wonder if... it really is you, in fact...
What?
You're just fishing around, because you're the one who's changed sides!
What? What on earth are you talking about?
You're working for Holm, admit it!
No I'm not, don't be ridiculous...
He's asked you to flush out the traitors in his team, hasn't he?
Of course he hasn't...
Admit it!
[MINDREADING]
I'm sure he's lying!
I cannot make out what it is, but something is very wrong here...
I will not fall into a trap!
No, I'm telling you!
Come Duke Manuel, you're mistaken.
I've always served Lord Mortimer loyally!
I do not know what's wrong with you today, but you are behaving most strangely...
It's true, I confess
Well, yes! I confess!
And I've found you out, Godoy!
If you don't confess this minute, I will denounce you to Sir Gregory!
I suspected as much!
I was sure that...
Mmm.. no... wait... you are lying!
You are decidedly a very bad actor...
But I don't understand what you are up to...
France is following Mortimer, not Holm
Come, Godoy, you're getting yourself in a muddle with all your speculating!
The only true patron of France is, and always has been, Lord Mortimer!
I know... but something doesn't feel right and I cannot put my finger on it...
But let's assume...
It's wrong, I'm a man of my word
Are you joking?!
Upon my honor, I urge you to believe that I am not the sort to play on both sides of the fence, monsieur!
Very well, very well!
There's no point getting on your high horse!
If you are really working for Mortimer, why did he task you to question me like this?
[MINDREADING]
I do not understand!
If he really, really is here on behalf of Mortimer, all he would have to do is to tell me the code we agreed upon...
Whatever happens, if he doesn't say "hummingbird", it means I've fallen into a trap!...
Mortimer needs to know if he can count on you
Lord Mortimer trusts you, my Lord Duke.
But with all that's been going on, I admit he needs to feel supported.
And as you're a man of great qualities, in his opinion, he simply wanted to make sure that you will still support him.
Ah... now I understand.
I'm his right-hand-man
I'm his right-hand-man. I'm the one who takes care of any delicate matters.
You?
I would have thought that it would have been young de Richet, or President Washington.
Louis? Are you joking?
De Richet? That skinny runt?
Not on your life! Mortimer isn't mad, you know!
Yes, you're quite right...
Advancing with de Richet would equate to putting your own head on the block!
You Scumbag! I'll get you for that!
You can say that again...
Certainly not Washington
Washington?
You're dreaming, he's half senile. Mortimer only keeps him around for the sake of appearances.
A little respect, young man!
You're talking about a great man the likes of whom we shall probably never see again!
Well, frankly, Monsieur Bonaparte, I shall strongly advise Lord Mortimer to choose better team members.
It is not that I do not value you, but I sincerely think that President Washington would be a much better man for this kind of mission.
He is afraid you won't vote for him
You must understand his point of view.
He fears you might not dare follow him at the last minute.
That's all.
And with good reason...
How many times do I have to tell you that I will not be voting for Mortimer?
Is that clear?
Now do you get it? Have we finished?
Surely because he thought you would trust me
What a snob you are, Godoy.
Lord Mortimer simply thought that you would trust me.
You?
You are joking, I hope...
If not, Mortimer really is desperate, my poor man!
Hummingbird
Right, I think we've wasted enough time here...
I could not agree more!
Hummingbird!
Did you...
Pardon?
You heard me...
Hummingbird.
At last!
Heavens above, why did you not tell me before?
I didn't think I would need to.
Imbecile, someone could have caught us!
Good Outcome
Listen, I'll take your word for it but tell Mortimer that he's making me run too great a risk!
I already gave him my approval and we agreed not to speak about it on the island.
Just imagine for a minute if Holm had caught us. You might not know what he is capable of but I certainly do!
It would be the end of me!
The bastard! He really is a traitor!
Please excuse me, Duke Manuel. But that wasn't the intention.
I shall go and reassure Lord Mortimer about the vote, and I promise to avoid you running any more risks.
I hope so!
Now, please leave me. We must not be seen together!
Bad Outcome
Bonaparte, I really don't know what you're playing at but you seem completely off track.
For the last time, I shall follow Sir Gregory for the Louisiana vote and you can tell Mortimer that I'm not the kind to break my word!
Understood, but I...
I have nothing more to say!
Please leave me now!
My Lord Duke... My apologies for being late...
What? A Frenchman who apologizes?
Decidedly, my stay here has never ceased to uncover surprises...
So? Have you any more information about de Richet?
What do you mean?
Are you joking? We agreed you would check to see if de Richet really has changed sides!
Ah, that, yes indeed, it appears he has been brought over to Sir Gregory's side.
The traitor! He pushed me into turning against Sir Gregory to finally follow him himself!
[MANIPULATION] He must have found out something
If you want my opinion, he must be hiding something!
The villain! I was hoping he was just absent or busy snooping around all over the place in search of his mother!
No, it would seem he really has joined Sir Gregory.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I know what you mean!
I wager he knows Mortimer is going to lose the vote!
Don't you think we ought to think about ourselves and make sure we don't end up on the wrong side?
What? You would be prepared to leave Mortimer as well?
What do you say?
I refuse to be made a laughing stock!
[CONVICTION] The Golden Order has dropped Mortimer

I'll never be able to trust him!
He distills the information that he's willing to share, a drop at a time. He manipulates the people he needs, and gets rid of those in his way.
Sure, he's our father, but he can't count on me to follow him in everything he does.
Don't say anything, Louis
I don't know, it's... it's difficult to say.
He's our father, he's started to initiate me, and well he's been pretty decent...
...that said, you can't say he's gone about it in the best possible way to gain my total trust.
And you? What do you think?
Honestly, I don't know who to believe.
The only person I really trust is you.
So I'll follow you this time round.
I won't be voting for him.
I'm not convinced by his proposition. I'll be voting for Sir Gregory.
I understand.
In that case, I'll vote for Holm, like you.
But it won't please Father.
That's only to be expected.
But well... it's not my fault if he hasn't been able to convince me.
Don't worry, he'll get over it...
Right, I won't disturb you any further.
See you later for the vote.
See you in a while.
Emma?
Come in, Louis...
What can I do for you?
Well, the conference will be upon us soon, and I've found some more...
And right you are!
I wanted to wait a bit before speaking to you about it but as you are here...
I've been thinking about what we'll do when we get back.
How we ought to decorate the house, prepare the children's bedrooms...
Yes, I want three and the first born will be a boy, we'll call him Louis, after his father.
Oh great, this just keeps getting worse...
She's drifting deeper into madness.
I ought to help her!
Alright, I can't let her be taken advantage of for the sake of this cursed conference.
If Mortimer doesn't help her, then it'll have to come down to Holm!
Emma, listen to me...
Anyway, we'll have time to speak about it later.
Regarding the conference, as we're going to vote for Mortimer's project, I thought to myself, you ought to go and notify Sir Gregory that we won't be following him.
For Mortimer?
But... I thought you weren't on very good terms with him...
True. But he came and spoke to me and...
He... well, I'm not exactly sure but...
I shall vote for Mortimer!
Anyway, go and tell Gregory that we've changed our minds.
Madam, you shouldn't take part in that conference.
What would you say about returning to England?
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
It's not reasonna...
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
I see Father hasn't left her much choice here...
Very well. I'll go and tell Sir Gregory right away.
I'll see you later then, Madam.
I hope Gregory will be able to do something. She really needs help.
Too bad for her!
It's almost a pity but given what she's capable of doing...
I won't feel guilty about taking advantage of the situation!
She wanted to play, and she's lost!
Anyway, we'll have time to speak about it later.
Regarding the conference, as we're going to vote for Mortimer's project, I was thinking, you ought to go and notify Sir Gregory that we won't be following him.
Madam, I doubt that will go down very well with Sir Gregory.
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
I do understand but I don't think that...
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
Ah, right. He's completely turned her...
Let's not stay here any longer, I really don't feel like playing house with this madwoman.
Perfect, I shall go and tell Sir Gregory right away!
Don't crack, Louis. Leave what happened on the wharf behind you and don't let yourself be overwhelmed by anger!
Concentrate on the conference!
Come on, Louis!...
Duchess?
Come in, Louis. You've come at just the right time, my love.
I was about to come and see you.
Am I dreaming or is she making out like nothing ever happened...
I wanted to talk to you too.
Of course, but I shall start.

I've some important news to tell you.
And above all, try to stay calm.
I want you to know the truth because I see you here among us in total ignorance and it sincerely makes me sad.
What the hell are you talking about, for god's sake?
Ah Louis, don't start shouting!
Very well, Emily.
Very well, Emma.
I'm sorry, I lost my temper.
What is it you want to speak to me about?
Ah, that's more like it.
Well...
What I wanted to tell you...
Yes?
Is that you might...
I might what?
That you made an error here when you took me for Emily.
What... You...
I am Emma, Louis.
And that's not all.
I'm Mortimer's daughter as well.
We are brother and sister, Louis.
What, wait... But... I...
Oh! And, I am a Daemon.
There, now you know everything.
I feel better for it. I didn't want there to be any lies between us.
How do you feel?
Control yourself, Louis. Keep calm!
Keep concentrated, Louis!
Don't give anything away!
CON-CEN-TRATE!
Alright...
Alright? Are you alright about it?
Of course...
Oh, I was worried you'd take it the wrong way...
No! No, of course not...
Good, I'm glad.
You understand, if we are to move forward together, we have to be able to trust one another.
Move forward?
Of course...
Yes, once we're together.
I've been thinking about it, you know. Once we get back, we won't have to wait long before my poor husband passes...
Then we'll be able to get married.
Excuse me, get married?...
Oh, Louis, I've been thinking of nothing else!
My sister would never have made you happy, you know!
You'll see, I'll take care of everything and we'll be happy, my love.
Yes, o... of course we will.
But tell me, before all that, I... I was just wondering... What about the conference?
Don't worry, I've got everything sorted.
We shall follow Father.
He came to talk to me and persuaded me to join him!
Isn't it wonderful? We'll all be together, as a happy family!
Alright...
Alright, this... this is completly beyond me...
I see that you've thought about everything.
So, I'll just be off to tell Sir Gregory the bad news then...
Excellent idea, my darling!
It's the right thing to do!
See you in a while.
That poor woman is literally broken inside...
I may not be in love with her, but I wouldn't wish that upon anyone.
FILTHY BITCH!!
You're sick!!!
You... You're... a lunatic! You killed your own sister!!
You killed my mother!!
You deserve to end up on the gallows!
That's enough!!
I won't tolerate another word!
OUT!
If you think I'm going to let you get away with this kind of behavior, then you don't know me!
You better pull yourself together if you want me to forgive you!
De Richet! I told you that I did not have time for you, I will ask you to leave me alone.
Monsieur Bonapa...
AH! Excuse me, I was expecting someone else.
Monsieur Godoy, do you have a moment?
Your timing's awkward, de Richet, I'm expecting someone.
I haven't time, please leave me.
Very well, I won't insist...
Looks like he only wants to speak to Bonaparte.
I know what I have to do if I want to speak to him !
De Richet! I told you that I did not have time for you, I will ask you to leave me alone.
Monsieur Bonapa...
AH! Excuse me, I was expecting someone else.
Monsieur Godoy, do you have a moment?
Your timing's awkward, de Richet, I'm expecting someone.
I haven't time, please leave me.
Very well, I won't insist...
Looks like he only wants to speak to Bonaparte.
I know what I have to do if I want to speak to him !
Ah, Louis! I... was getting impatient.
So tell me, have you been able to speak to everyone?
Absolutely.
And? Did you find a... a traitor in our midst?
Before I go any further, I'd like to talk about Emma.
Yes, what's wrong?
She is ill, Uncle.
She needs help, she cannot reasonably take part in the conference.
What do you mean?
Louis, I know that what happened recently was difficult for Emma but do you realize what you're asking of me?
Sir, she is completely out of her mind.
Even if you asked her to vote, you wouldn't be able to guarantee she will vote for you.
She's locked herself in an absurd fantasy world.
I implore you, don't make her do this.
Well, I can see there is great kindness in you, Louis, but I'm afraid...
Make her leave. Find an institution that can help her, please sir.
You don't need her to win the vote.
Whatever happens, I'm with you and I can assure you of my vote. We can't lose.
Very well.
I have always attached great importance to our family and even though it saddens me to confess it, I must agree with you that the poor girl is in a very bad way.
I will tell William that I'm removing the Duchess from the conference and that he must organize her departure right away.
Will that satisfy you?
Well, Emma has become deranged since the death of her sister...
She thinks we're going to get married and...
I'll take care of her. It's the after-effects which are only to be expected. I'll go and see her, rest assured.
That will be perfect.
Thank you, Uncle.
So?
Are you going to tell me if there is a traitor amongst us?
Any news of Piaggi?
He's a traitor
If I were you, I wouldn't count on Cardinal Piaggi.
The scoundrel!
I've given him everything and this is how he thanks me!
I wouldn't be surprised if he and my father have been close allies for a long time.
He'll get what's coming to him!
He is not a traitor
You can count on him...
As always!
And President Washington?
Can we count on him?
Washington is a traitor
Unfortunately, President Washington has changed sides.
I must admit it comes as no surprise.
My brother has always followed him and I was expecting this reversal.
Washington is not a traitor
Mr President is maintaining a favorable position towards us.
Well, that's as surprising as it is pleasant to hear!
Can we trust Emma?
Emma betrayed us
Emma won't be voting for you...
I saved her life! If it weren't for me, she would have died when Sarah shot her!
I'm the one who arranged her healing!
Apparently she...
I should have left her to die!
She doesn't deserve our blood!
Emma did not betray us
Emma? She's on your side of course!
Yes... She is a valued asset...
What's your opinion of Duke Manuel?
Godoy is a traitor
Duke Manuel won't be supporting us.
How dare he!
If it weren't for me, he wouldn't be where he is today!
I had to trick him in order to make sure.
I passed inside Napoleon so that he would talk to me.
Congratulations, Louis!
I see you're not one to stop at half measures.
I pretended that I was only checking he was still working for Mortimer.
And he confessed?
He was suspicious right to the end, but yes, he ended up giving himself away and conceded he was working for your brother.
The scoundrel!
Godoy is a traitor
I... I wouldn't trust him...
Right... so that's your intuition.
Godoy is not a traitor
He is a loyal and faithful friend of your cause...
I never once doubted him!
Can I count on Emily?
Yes, she is with us!
Yes, she's on your side.
I was right to trust her...
I don't know if it's of any importance but Father has given her a bodyguard...
A servant dressed in black?
Yes, is... is this detail important?
I hope not...
We'll see.
No, Emily betrayed us
Against all odds, I think she will join the opposing side.
The traitor! She will pay for this!
I can't believe it!
And... Von Wöllner.. what's your feeling about him?
Wöllner is trustworthy
He's thoroughly committed to your cause, without a shadow of a doubt!
I never doubted him but... best to be sure!
Talk to him about the letter found
He is on your side...
However, it seems that Mortimer feels certain he can get him to change his mind.
You mean, blackmail him?
That's impossible...
I don't know, but I thought it wise to warn you...
Yes... I see.
Wöllner is a traitor
We can't count on von Wöllner...
Pardon me?
I know that it will come as a shock to you but...
The little coward! I've always said he was a weakling!
Thank you, Louis, for all this information.
I only hope what you say is right. The consequences could be horrific.
That is what we are likely to see...
William has moved his pieces!
If that's how it is, it's my turn now!
What are you going to do?
Show him that I am not going to be outdone!
Prepare yourself...
It won't be long before the conference begins. There's just enough time to briefly go over it once more with my guests.
Let us meet in the conference room when the time comes.
Have you seen everyone?
Please leave me now, Louis.
Please leave me now.
My friends, here we all are.
We... are about to definitively shelve Lord Mortimer's absurd project regarding Louisiana.
It will only take one of you to oppose it and we have won.
The vote is to be held shortly so we must keep our guard up.
I'm sure Mortimer's preparing something.
Don't worry, Sir Gregory. Nothing can stop us now.
Beware, Johann. We mustn't underestimate him.
So I'll ask you to return to your rooms and stay there until the conference.
And if one of Mortimer's team comes knocking at your door, no matter what, do not open it under any circumstance!
Don't give them the opportunity to manipulate you!
Is that clear?
Understood.
Good.
Count on me.
As you wish.
Right, let us adjourn...
Er, Louis, stay a... a moment, if you would.
I need to speak to you.
Yes, what can I do for you?
I've known my brother for a long time. I'm sure he has a plan.
I'd like you to go and see each member of our group and make sure they remain loyal.
He fears my father's reaction...
Do you think my father is going to try to turn some of them to his side?
Turn them or get rid of them, I don't know.
Don't intervene
One thing's for sure, I doubt William will give up without a fight, he'll try something.
I'll keep him busy while you check on all of our group.
Can I trust you?
Of course...
If there is a traitor in our group, find out who it is, Louis!
Find them then come back and let me know, I'll deal with them personally.
I want a landslide victory! I want to teach William a lesson!
And bring that ridiculous Godoy back over...
Now that you've persuaded him to switch to Mortimer's side, it would be preferable to bring him back quickly.
We'll still need him and I don't want him going down with Mortimer.
Very well, it will be done.
Wait a minute... Isn't the Duchess supposed to be here?
No, no, she's, er... resting in her... in her room.
I confess I'm a little worried about her mental health.
She's going through a very difficult time at the moment and I wouldn't want my brother to exploit her fragility.
I'll go now.
Thank you, Louis. See you in a while.
It's time to get going...
Monsieur Bonaparte...
Leave me, thank you!
Monsieur Bonaparte...
Louis!
Do you want something?
Yes, for you to test the duke's loyalty, since he'll only speak to you.
Well...
Whatever it is, I haven't the time.
The conference will shortly begin and I want to be focused, sorry.
Come back and see me afterwards.
I see I haven't much choice...
I have no time to spare!
Leave him
I'll be leaving you.
See you later.
Take control of his body
Seeing as Godoy will only talk to Bonaparte and Bonaparte will talk to no one, I have no other choice but to borrow his body...
Nothing personal here, Napoleon!
Look, I'm sorry!
This conference is of utmost importance to me and I should like to be prepared for it.
Concentrate, Louis...
You don't mind if I sit down, do you?
I don't want to fall flat on my face when my spirit passes inside you...
No, I don't think you've understood, de Richet...
Link into his thoughts, Louis. Come on.
I said I did not want to be disturbed...
That's it, I sense something...
What word in "leave me alone" do you not understand?
Come on, just keep going and get inside his mind...
NOW!
Too bad for you! You can't say that I haven't...
...thank you very much for the loan of this body, monsieur.
Right, let's not waste any more time, Louis, Godoy is waiting!
Louis!
My God, it's becoming an obsession.
I asked you to leave.
Monsieur Bonaparte...
Louis! Indeed a surprise...
Aren't you supposed to be double-locked inside your room, like your allies?
Hah, actually, I've always thought that in order to make an attempt at humor it is preferable to have some...
Right, that's enough, you are wasting my time!
Leave me, thank you!
I've no time to spare!
Monsieur Bonaparte...
Louis!
Indeed a surprise... Aren't you supposed to be double-locked inside your room, like your allies?!
Don't get defensive, Louis...
Monsieur is teasing me.
French humor, something you at least know a little about...
Please don't take it the wrong way.
Did you want something?
Yes, for you to test the duke's loyalty, since that he will speak to no one but you.
Well...
Whatever it is, I haven't the time.
The conference will shortly begin and I want to be focused, sorry.
Come back and see me afterwards.
I see I haven't much choice...
Leave him
I'll be leaving you.
See you later.
Take control of his body
Seeing as Godoy will only talk to Bonaparte and Bonaparte will talk to no one, I have no other choice but to borrow his body...
Don't hold it against me, Napoleon!
Look, I'm sorry!
This conference is of utmost importance to me and I should like to be prepared for it.
Concentrate, Louis...
 You don't mind if I sit down.
I don't want to fall flat on my face when my spirit passes inside you...
No, I don't think you've understood, de Richet...
Link into his thoughts, Louis.
I said I did not want to be disturbed...
That's it, I sense something...
What word in "leave me alone" do you not understand?
Just stay on him and pass inside...
NOW!
Too bad for you! You can't say that I haven't...
...thank you very much for this loan, monsieur.
Right, let's not waste any more time, Louis, Godoy is waiting!
Louis!
My God, it's becoming an obsession.
I asked you to leave.
Leave him
I'll be going.
See you later.
Take control of his body
“No need to hurry with Wöllner.
We are certain that he will concede given the severity of it all.
Best surprise him at the last minute.”
“No need to hurry with Wöllner.
We are certain that he will concede given the severity of it all.
Best surprise him at the last minute.”
Looks like Wöllner's opposition is in the line of fire...
I don't like the sound of that...
Your Eminence?
Oh, Louis... What can I do for you?
Not too nervous about the conference?
Even if I add Lord Mortimer's reaction into the equation, I must admit I don't know how we can lose.
It will only take one of us to vote against his project and the idea will be definitively dropped.
Knowing Mortimer, I wouldn't be surprised if he still had a few tricks up his sleeve.
You are thinking about something?
[MINDREADER]
Dear God, I am doomed!
He knows!
He knows I'll be voting for Mortimer.. but how?
The scoundrel! He's a traitor!!
Maybe he has turned some of Holm's guests
Let's say it wouldn't be impossible for Mortimer to influence some of Holm's supporters so they vote in favor of his project.
Come, Louis.
You don't really mean that!
And if it were like that, I can assure you that Sir Gregory would have noticed.
You are worrying over nothing.
Very well.
So everything is fine, then.
Better safe than sorry, right?
You are right, and frankly, you have absolutely nothing to fear.
Perfect.
Allow me to leave you then.
I am expected elsewhere.
Of course, please do.
You could betray Holm, for example.
Well, maybe he has managed to motivate some of Sir Gregory's supporters to vote for his project, for example?
I... No, you can't be serious.
Do... do you know anyone capable of that, Louis?
Yes... Yes I do indeed know someone.
Who then?
Double dealing cheat! So you're the mole!
Do you really want me to tell you, your Eminence?
What do you mean? I'm not sure that I understand.
Confess!
I think you know better than anyone who would be capable of pretending to be on Sir Gregory's side while secretly planning to betray him.
What are you saying, Louis! I don't follow you!
You are not really suggesting that...
Oh I don't need to suggest anything.
The situation seems clearer by the minutes...
Louis, it's not what you think!
I owe William everything! It's thanks to him that I took the holy orders!
Off come the masks, your Emininence...
I beg you, try to understand!
I owe him a favor!
Of course you do...
Louis, I haven't any choice!
You don't say no to Mortimer! You know this very well!
If you ignore him, you'll sooner or later pay the price!
I see.
He just has to ask and you give in.
I beg you! Don't say a word to Sir Gregory or I'm done for!
In the name of your mother, I implore you to keep it to yourself!
Promise to say nothing
Very well.
I promise I won't say anything.
Oh thank you, Louis!
I knew I could trust you!
Sarah would be proud of you...
Don't push it, your Eminence.
Yes, of course.
Well, I'll be going.
I've got things to do.
See you in a while...
Promise nothing
Your Eminence, you've only got yourself to thank for the situation you're in.
Don't count on me to get you out of it.
I'm not promising anything here.
But... I...
What...
Goodbye, your Eminence.
I'll see you at the conference.
Promise him you'll speak to Holm about it.
I'll make you a promise, your Eminence!
Oh, thank you, Louis...
I promise that nothing and no one will keep me from revealing every traitor to Holm!
What... but... no!
Louis... I...
I'll see you at the conference!
Goodbye!
And what if Holm has been double-crossed?
You don't think Sir Gregory could have been duped at the last minute, do you?
Sir Gregory?!
Certainly not!
You don't know him very well if you think he wouldn't have seen a betrayal coming.
I can assure you, there is nothing to be worried about, my friend.
Fine, you are probably right...
Don't worry, we shall win the vote, you'll see!
Is there anything else you wanted to speak to me about?
No, that's all.
I'll be leaving now.
See you later, my son.
You've known Mortimer for a long time, haven't you?
I... I was just wondering, exactly how long have you known Lord Mortimer?
Well!
What are you suggesting, Louis? Are you losing your mind or what?!
You haven't answered the question…
I refuse to play at this game! And I'll ask you to stop making such inappropriate assumptions!
I might well have known Lord Mortimer for a very long time, but we have never mixed business interests with our personal affections.
Fine, no need to get upset, your Eminence.
It was just a question...
Well, your question is wrong!
Understood.
On that note, if you don't mind I'll be going, your Eminence.
Perfect! Please do!
Your Eminence?
Oh, Louis... What can I do for you?
Not too nervous about the conference?
Even if I add Lord Mortimer's reaction into the equation, I must admit I don't know how we can lose.
It will only take one of us to vote against his project and the idea will be definitively dropped.

Dear God, I am doomed!
He knows!

The scoundrel! He's a traitor!!
[MANIPULATION] You could betray Holm, for example.
Well, maybe he has managed to motivate some of Sir Gregory's supporters to vote for his project, for example?
I... No, you can't be serious.
Do... do you know anyone capable of that, Louis?
Yes, I do indeed know someone.
Who then?
Double dealing cheat! So you're the mole!
Do you really want me to tell you, your Eminence?
What do you mean? I'm not sure that I understand.
Confess!
I think you know better than anyone who would be capable of pretending to be on Sir Gregory's side while secretly planning to openly betray him.
Really, Louis! I don't follow you!
You are not really suggesting that...
Oh I don't need to suggest anything.
The situation seems clearer by the minute, on the contrary...
Louis, it's not what you think!
I owe William everything! It's thanks to him that I took the holy orders!
Off come the masks, your Emininence...
I beg you, try to understand!
I owe him a favor!
Of course you do...
Louis, I haven't any choice!
You don't say no to Mortimer! You know this very well!

In the name of your mother, I implore you to keep it to yourself!
Promise to say nothing
Very well.
I promise I won't say anything.
Oh thank you, Louis!
I knew I could trust you!
Sarah would be proud of you...
Don't overdo it, your Eminence.
Yes, of course.
Well, I'll be going.
I've got things to do.
See you in a while...
Promise nothing
Your Eminence, you've only yourself to thank for getting into this situation.
Don't count on me to get you out of it.
I'm not promising anything.
But... I...
What...
Goodbye, your Eminence.
I'll see you at the conference.
Promise him you'll speak to Holm about it.
I'll make you a promise, your Eminence!
Oh, thank you, Louis...
I promise that nothing and no one will keep me from revealing every traitor to Holm!
What... but... no!
Louis... I...
I'll see you at the conference!
Goodbye!
Maybe he has turned some of Holm's guests
Let's say it wouldn't be impossible for Mortimer to influence some of Holm's supporters so they vote in favor of his project.
Come, Louis.
You don't really mean that!
And if it were like that, I can assure you that Sir Gregory would have noticed.
You are worrying over nothing.
Very well.
Then everything is fine, then.
Better safe than sorry, right?
You are right, and frankly, you have absolutely nothing to fear.
Perfect.
Allow me to leave you then.
I am expected.
Of course, please do.
[LOGIQUE] You've known Mortimer for a long time, haven't you?
I was wondering, exactly how long have you known Lord Mortimer?
Well!
What are you suggesting, Louis? Are you losing your mind or what?!
You haven't answered the question...
I refuse to play at this game! And I'll ask you to stop making such inappropriate assumptions!
I might well have known Lord Mortimer for a very long time, but we have never mixed business interests with our personal affections,
Very well, no need to get upset, your Eminence.

Well, your question is wrong!

Perfect! Please do!
And what if Holm has been double-crossed?
You don't think Sir Gregory could have been duped at the last minute, do you?
Sir Gregory?!
Certainly not!
You don't know him very well if you think he wouldn't have seen a betrayal coming.
I can assure you, there is nothing to be worried about, my friend.
Fine, you are probably right...
Don't worry, we shall win the vote, you'll see!
Is there anything else you wanted to speak to me about?
No, that's all.
I'll be going.
See you later, my son.
Mister President, would you have a minute to spare?
Of course, Louis.
What can I do for you?
I wanted to make sure that you're still with us.
Since Mortimer has to convince everyone to follow him to win the vote, well, I expect he'll try bringing you over to his side eventually.
I won't lie, William did make a point of speaking to me.
And?...
He has always supported me, Louis.
I've been thinking long and hard about this. I know I said I would vote for Holm, but I've been reconsidering.
I'm sorry but I won't be following you this time round.
Well at least that's clear.
Holm's the one who is going to be delighted about this reversal...
I'm sorry for you.
Good luck and see you later at the conference.
See you later.
Mister President, would you have a minute to spare?
Of course, Louis.
What can I do for you?
I wanted to make sure that you are still with us.
Seeing as Mortimer has to convince everyone to follow him to win the vote of his own conference, I expect he will try to bring you over to his side.
I won't lie, William did make a point of speaking to me.
And?...
He has always supported me, Louis.
I've been thinking long and hard about this. I know I said I would vote for Holm, but I've been thinking.
I'm sorry but I won't be following you this time round.
Well at least that's clear.
Holm's the one who's going to be delighted about this reversal...
I'm sorry for you.
Good luck and see you later at the conference.
See you later.
Ah, Louis.
Come closer, I'm warming myself up.
I was unfortunate enough to step outside and now I'm freezing...
SUCCESS
I wonder what he's been doing outside.
Something to do with what Holm asked of him maybe...
He's back from the landing stage...
Damn, he must have gone to deposit Al Azif for someone to pick up...
(default)
So, tell me, my friend, what can I do for you?
And this is the scumbag that tried to poison me...
DON'T TAKE REVENGE
HIT WOLLNER
Are you insane?
What's the matter with you?!
Shut your mouth!
But... I...
Next time you want to attack someone, at least have the courage to do it to their face...
Instead of poisoning them when they're helpless!
To be honest, I should have slit your throat...
Since you went crying to Gregory, he's expelled me from the island.
I have one hour to leave!
Oh, isn't that a pity, so now you're not staying for the conference, huh?
You've got your revenge!
If I stay, I'm a dead man and you know it!
You certainly won't find me complaining..
Don't insist
And if I ever see you again, you can be sure I won't miss my chance to pay you back double.
I knew you'd bring me bad luck!
I've lost everything because of you!
I wouldn't complain, you're still alive.
That said, I wouldn't expect King Frederick William to support you much longer.
I curse you!
Why did he do it?
But before you leave, tell me: why did you suddenly want to kill me?
You are just Mortimer's son!
So what?
Precisely! Yet here they are, both of them, bowing and scraping to you!
I had to follow Gregory for ten years in the hope that he would initiate me!
What are you, jealous of me?!
Mortimer ignores you for years, and then he enthrones you ten minutes after you are introduced!
I am Holm's son and he still hasn't taught me anything!
I am a Daemon too! And if they didn't hold me back, I would certainly be one of the best!
Better than you!
I guess we'll never know now...
I curse you!
Really. I thought you preferred poisoning people while they were unconscious!
That rascal Piaggi told you!
I knew it. I should have gotten rid of both of you!
The result: now, I'm asked to leave the island!
I wouldn't complain, it's a small price to pay!
Now, get out!
You won't be taking it with you to heaven, de Richet!
Yeah, yeah! And good luck in the future without the support of Sir Gregory!
I curse you, you bastard!
His Eminence couldn't hold his tongue, I see.
Anyway, I have no regrets! He got what he deserved!
What do you mean?
Oh, you don't know?
You'll see, I've put together a little surprise for you!
Careful, von Wöllner, you're playing with fire here!
Oh, you think you can frighten me?
You're forgetting who I serve!
You have no power over me!
His Eminence couldn't hold his tongue, I see.
I knew I should have gotten rid of the old codger! I should have known he would give me away!
I'll get him!
I think you're forgetting whose house you're in.
Please, Lord Mortimer will never let you harm one of his guests, not under his own roof.
Sir Gregory has tasked me with making sure that all his allies don't change their minds over the conference...
MINDREADING
Dammit, it drives me mad!
How can Father doubt my loyalty to him for a single second?
I have always been devoted to him, body and soul!!...
Who are you going to vote for?
Are you still going to vote for Sir Gregory?
Did he ask you?
I knew it...
You need have no fear. I've always been loyal to him.
Very well.
And what proof do you have?
Absolutely none.
And I couldn't care less about convincing you.
On that note, see you later perhaps.
What a scumbag...
I know he killed Piaggi.
All those that are still alive, at least.
I know you killed him...
I beg your pardon?
Piaggi.
You're the one who killed him...
But... I...
I didn't say anything.
But I know it was you.
So, I'll see you later at the conference, and don't make any more stupid mistakes.
Make sure you vote against Mortimer.
That was my intention anyway, with or without your impotent threats.
They are going to blackmail you
I've heard that someone's going to try and blackmail you into changing your mind and that...
Oh ha ha ha! You amuse me, de Richet...
They can always try, they will be made welcome!
So you think that there's no way that they can blackmail you then?
Right, at first this was amusing, now it's becoming ridiculous, Louis.
Just let them try!
Come now, stop wasting my time, I have things I need to do.
Please leave me now, you have surely better things to do.
Ah, Louis.
Come closer, I'm warming myself up.
I was unfortunate enough to step outside and now I'm freezing...
SUCCESS
I wonder what he's been up to outside.
Something to do with what Holm asked of him maybe...
He's back from the landing stage...
Damn, he must have gone to deposit Al Azif for someone to pick up...
(default)
So, tell me, my friend, what can I do for you?
And to think this scumbag tried to poison me...
DON'T TAKE REVENGE
HIT WOLLNER
Are you mad?
What's the matter with you?!
Shut your mouth!
But... I...
Next time you want to attack someone, at least have the courage to do it to their face...
Instead of poisoning them when they are unconscious!
To be honest, I should have slit your throat...
Since you went crying to Gregory, he's expelled me from the island.
I have one hour to leave!
What a pity, so you're not staying for the conference?
You've got your revenge!
If I stay, I'm a dead man and you know it!
You certainly won't find me complaining..
Don't insist
And if I ever see you again, be sure it I won't miss my chance to pay you back in kind.
I knew you'd bring me bad luck!
I've lost everything because of you!
I wouldn't complain, you're still alive.
That said, I wouldn't expect King Frederick William to be supporting you much longer.
I curse you!
Why did he do it?
But before you leave, tell me why you suddenly wanted to kill me.
You are just Mortimer's son!
So what?
Precisely!  Yet here they are, both of them, bowing and scraping to you!
I had to follow Gregory for ten years in the hope that he would initiate me!
You're jealous of me?!
Mortimer ignores you for years, and then he enthrones you 10 minutes after you are introduced!
I am Holm's son and he still hasn't taught me anything!
I'm a Daemon too! And if they didn't hold me back, I would certainly be one of the best!
Better than you!
We shall never know now...
I curse you!
Really. I thought you preferred poisoning people while they are unconscious!
That rascal Piaggi told you!
I knew it.  I should have gotten rid of both of you!
The result: now I'm asked to leave the island!
I wouldn't complain, it's a small price to pay!
Now, get out!
You won't be taking it with you to heaven, de Richet!
Yeah, yeah! And good luck in the future without the support of Sir Gregory!
I curse you!
His Eminence couldn't hold his tongue I see.
Anyway, I have no regrets! He got what he deserved!
What do you mean?
Oh, you don't know?
You'll see, I've put together a little surprise for you!
Careful Wöllner, you're playing with fire!
You think you can frighten me?
You forget who I serve!
You have no power over me!
His Eminence couldn't hold his tongue I see.
I knew I should have gotten rid of the old codger! I should have known he would give me away!
I'll get him!
I think you're forgetting whose house you're in.
Lord Mortimer will never let you harm one of his guests, here under his own roof.
Sir Gregory has tasked me with making sure that all his allies don't change their minds over the conference...
MINDREADING
Dammit, it drives me mad!
How can Father doubt my loyalty toward him for a single second?
I have always been devoted to him, body and soul!!...
Who are you going to vote for?
Are you still going to vote for Sir Gregory?
Did he ask you?
I knew it...
You need have no fear. I've always been loyal to him.
Very well.
And what proof do you have?
Absolutely none.
And I couldn't care less about convincing you.
On that note, see you later perhaps.
What a scumbag...
[IF LOUIS HAS ALREADY SEEN PIAGGI DEAD] I know he killed Piaggi.
All those who are still alive, at least.
I know you killed him...
I beg you pardon?
Piaggi.
You're the one who killed him...
But... I...
I didn't say anything.
But I know it was you.
So, see you later at the conference, and don't make any more stupid mistakes.
Make sure you vote against Mortimer.
That was my intention anyway, with or without your impotent threats.
They are going to blackmail you
I have been given to believe that they are going to blackmail you into changing your mind and that...
Ha ha ha! You amuse me, de Richet...
They can always try, they will be made welcome!
So you think there is no way they can blackmail you then?
Right, at first this was amusing, now it's becoming ridiculous, Louis.
Just let them try!
Come now, stop wasting my time, I have things I need to do.
I've some important news to tell you.
And above all, try to stay calm.
I want you to know the truth because I see you here among us in total ignorance and it sincerely makes me sad.
What the hell are you talking about, for god's sake?
Ah, Louis, don't start shouting!
Very well, Emily.
Very well, Emma.
I'm sorry, I lost my temper.
What is it you want to speak to me about?
Ah, that's more like it.
Well...
What I wanted to tell you...
Yes?
Is that you might...
I might what?
That you made an error here when you took me for Emily.
What... You...
I am Emma, Louis.
And that's not all.
I'm Mortimer's daughter as well.
We are brother and sister, Louis.
What, wait... But... I...
Oh! And, I am a Daemon.
There, now you know everything.
I feel better for it. I didn't want there to be any lies between us.
How do you feel?
Keep control of yourself, Louis. Keep calm!
Keep concentrated, Louis!
Don't give anything away!
CON-CEN-TRATE!
Alright...
Alright? Are you alright about it?
Of course...
Oh, I was worried you'd take it the wrong way...
Nooo! No, of course not...
Good, I'm glad.
You understand, if we are to move forward together, we have to be able to trust one another.
Move forward?
Of course...
Yes, once we're together.
I've been thinking about it, you know. Once we get back, we won't have to wait long before my poor husband passes...
Then we'll be able to get married.
Excuse me, get married?...
Oh, Louis, I've been thinking of nothing else!
My sister would never have made you happy, you know!
You'll see, I'll take care of everything and we'll be happy, my love.
Yes, o... of course we will.
But tell me, before all that, I... I was just wondering... What about the conference?
Don't worry, I've got everything sorted.
We shall follow Father.
He came to talk to me and persuaded me to join him!
Isn't it wonderful? We'll all be together, as a happy family!
Alright...
Alright, this... this is completly beyond me...
I see that you've thought about everything.
So, I'll just be off to tell Sir Gregory the bad news then...
Excellent idea, my darling!
It's the right thing to do!
See you in a while.
That poor woman is literally broken inside...
I may not be in love with her, but I wouldn't wish that upon anyone.
FILTHY BITCH!!
You're sick!!!
You... You're... a lunatic! You killed your own sister!!
You killed my mother!!
You deserve to end up on the gallows!
That's enough!!
I won't tolerate another word!
OUT!
If you think I'm going to let you get away with this kind of behavior, then you don't know me!
You better pull yourself together if you want me to forgive you!
So, do we agree?
Agreed.
Let's return to our places now.
You're right.
Hmm... what were they talking about?
So, do we agree?
Agreed.
Let's return to our places now.
You're right.
Hmm... what were they talking about?
Louis, a moment of your time, please.
Yes, monsieur.
What can I do for you?
I would like you to hear me out without interrupting, it's in your interest.
You are in a perilous situation and I want to avoid you becoming a laughing stock.
He is kind...
That's very kind of you...
What's he talking about?
What exactly are you talking about?
The reason why we are all here!
You might think you can win but...
Indeed, it looks that way, doesn't it.
Well, think again! You don't know everything.
In actual fact, all of Sir Gregory's team is working for Mortimer.
If you vote for Holm, Mortimer will never forgive you.
And I can assure you that he has taken down far tougher than you.
Are you threatening me?
Not me, Louis.
But you are the only one who hasn't turned against Sir Gregory.
Join us, vote with us if you do not want to feel the wrath of Mortimer, alone.
Is that all?
That's all, yes.
I just wanted to warn you.
Now, you are free to vote where your conscience leads you.
Good luck.
So he's the one who's been persuading them all to turn back...
I just got to hope that Holm has managed to pull off his conjuring trick. Otherwise Bonaparte's right, I'll be the only one voting against Mortimer and therefore the only one to face the consequences...
Louis, a moment of your time, please.
Yes, monsieur.
What can I do for you?
I would like you to hear me out without interrupting, it's in your interest.
You are in a perilous situation and I want to avoid you becoming a laughing stock.
He is kind...
Very kind of you...
What's he talking about?
What exactly are you talking about?
The reason why we are all here!
You might think you can win but...
Indeed, it's looking pretty much like it.
Well, think again! You don't know everything.
In actual fact, all of Sir Gregory's team is working for Mortimer.
If you vote for Holm, Mortimer will never forgive you.
And I can assure you that he's taken down far tougher than you.
Are you threatening me?
Not me, Louis.
But you are the only one who hasn't turned against Sir Gregory.
Join us, vote with us if you don't want to feel the wrath of Mortimer alone.
Is that all?
That's all, yes.
I just wanted to warn you.

Good luck.
So he's the one who has been persuading them all to turn back...
I hope that Holm has managed to pull off his conjuring trick.   Otherwise Bonaparte is right, I'll be the only one voting for Mortimer and therefore the only one to face the consequences...
Your Eminence?
...
Your...
Goddammit! Your Eminence!
Damn...
I can't feel his pulse...
He's dead...
What the hell is going on here...
I've got to let Mortimer and Holm know about this.
Can you tell us how you found him, Louis?
I went to speak to him about the conference, I knocked on his door.
As there was no answer, I... I went in and I... I saw him exactly where he's now.
I took his pulse but it was too late.
William?!
Nothing to do with me, Gregory, if that's what you mean.
And you?
Of course not, poor Giuseppe was with me. I had no interest in getting rid of him.
Louis?
Me? Of course not!
No, I thought as much.
I was wondering if you had any idea about what might have happened.
Say nothing
No, I've got no idea!
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure. I haven't the faintest idea of who did this.
Well... we'll take care of it now. Thank you for letting us know, Louis
I shall inform everyone that his Eminence has had to return to the continent for personal reasons.
I must ask you to keep it to yourself.
Wöllner had threatened him.
I know who might have held a grudge against him.
Really! And who might that be?
Well... it's... it's awkward...
Don't worry, you can talk in front of me, Louis.
I gave no such order and if it concerns one of my guests, I need to know their identity.
Well, there's Mr von Wöllner...
Johann?
Continue, Louis.
Why do you think Johann would have had a grudge against his Eminence?
I heard him making threats.
When he tried to attack me earlier, Piaggi stepped in and Mr von Wöllner swore he would get even.
Gregory!
Wait, William!
You mustn't judge Johann prematurely!
Under my roof?!
William! If Johann has anything to do with this tragedy, I demand the right to take care of it personally!
He knew the rules and I will not tolerate him attacking a guest like this!
I'm asking you to let me handle it!
It's against my better judgement, but permission granted.
Don't make a mess of it, though, or I'll take care of him personally.
Very well. I'll be about my business. I will find out exactly how this happened!
Thank you for informing us, Louis.
I shall inform everyone that his Eminence has had to return to the continent for personal reasons.
I must ask you to keep it to yourself.
Say nothing
Good.
I'll be leaving you now, I must get back to my study.
Let us resume our activities. Gregory will inform us once he's made progress.
Time is of the essence, come back to me the minute you've finished what you started.
What's going to happen to Wöllner ?
If von Wöllner is the murderer, what's gonna happen to him?
He may be Gregory's son, but if he hasn't departed within the hour, I'll take care of him myself. It will not be pretty.
A lifetime as a masked servant should cleanse him of the desire to commit an act like that ever again in my house.
How will Holm find out the truth?
How can you be so sure that Sir Gregory will find out the truth?
I'll ask you to adopt a different tone with me, if you please.
I'm not one of those halfwits who blurt out the first idea that comes into their heads.
And I thought you had understood that we have very efficient means of finding out the truth, Louis.
It's not in my brother's interest to try and cover up such an act.
Not in my house.
He knows the rules and what they stand for.
Your Eminence?
...
Your...
Goddammit! Your Eminence!
Damn...
I can't feel his pulse...
He's dead...
What the hell is going on here...
I must absolutely let Mortimer and Holm know.
Can you tell us how you found him, Louis?
I went to speak to him about the conference, I knocked on his door.
As there was no answer, I went in and I saw him exactly where he is now.
I took his pulse but it was too late.

Gregory!
Wait,  William!

Good.
I'll be leaving you, got to get back to my study.
Let us resume our activities. Gregory will inform us once he has made progress.
Time is of the essence, come back to me once you've finished what you started.
[CONVICTION] How will Holm find out the truth?
How can you really be sure that Sir Gregory will find out the truth?
I'll ask you to adopt a different tone with me, if you please.
I'm not one of those halfwits who blurt out the first idea that comes into their heads.
And I thought you had understood that we have very efficient means of finding out the truth, Louis.

If Wöllner is the murderer, what will happen to him?
He may be Gregory's son, but if he hasn't departed within the hour, I'll take care of him myself.
A life as a masked servant should cleanse him of the desire to commit such an atrocious act here in my house.
I took mental control of Manuel Godoy
I convinced Manuel Godoy
I failed to convince Manuel Godoy
I convinced Johann von Wöllner
I failed to convince Johann von Wöllner
I convinced Giuseppe Piaggi
I failed to convince Giuseppe Piaggi
I convinced Lady Hillsborrow
I failed to convince Lady Hillsborrow
I convinced George Washington
I failed to convince George Washington
I swung the deciding vote in favor of Lord Mortimer
I swung the deciding vote in favor of Sir Holm
I found out about the poisoning of Giuseppe Piaggi
I spoke with Manuel Godoy
I spoke with Johann von Wöllner
I spoke with Giuseppe Piaggi
I spoke with Lady Hillsborrow
I spoke with George Washington
I participated in the vote
I took mental control of Napoleon Bonaparte
I revealed the poisoning of Giuseppe Piaggi by Johann von Wöllner 
I tried to convince the guests to follow Lord Mortimer's plan
I spoke with the guests who were supposed to be supporting Sir Holm
You should get ready for the conference, Louis.
My friends, here we are at last, gathered together to close this conference.
I would first of all like to thank you all for making the time to be here and lend your services.
Gregory, I... I believe I may speak for both of us, when I say that we are honored by your presence here.
You... you are perfectly right to do so, William.
Thank you... for putting your faith in us and for coming here to participate... in this conference.
Thank you for helping us to make... the best decisions.
And I especially want to thank you, William.. for... for... perfectly hosting us at your home during these past several days.
I'm not sure all the guests would agree to that...
In any case, Holm doesn't seem to be himself...
I would like to add that unfortunately, Monsieur von Wöllner has been called away at the last moment and will not be able to participate in the vote.
And that is not all...
Duchess Hillsborrow will also not be voting.
The poor woman has suffered a lot of upheaval lately.
As she was feeling quite poorly, she apologizes, but she preferred to return to the continent.
The Duchess?
I hope it's nothing serious?
Don't worry, Mr President.
I had someone escort her. The duchess simply needs rest and now she is in good hands.
And finally...
Cardinal Piaggi has also decided to leave us and will not be able to attend the conference.
I must say, Sir Gregory, you are beset by bad luck.
Indeed, one would think that I am hounded by ill fortune.
As you will have noticed, Monsieur Péru is also absent.
Good, I think we can begin.
You will vote in turn on the question that interests us today.
Are you FOR or AGAINST the transfer of ownership of Louisiana from Spain to France?
Monsieur de Richet?
VOTE FOR
I vote FOR.
VOTE AGAINST
I vote AGAINST
Duchess Hillsborrow?
FOR
AGAINST
FOR
AGAINST
Duke Manuel?
FOR
Damn it!... I didn't realize he was also a traitor...
AGAINST
Your Eminence?
FOR
But... I...
Gregory, please...
AGAINST
Monsieur Napoleon?
FOR
Mr Von Wöllner?
FOR
What?! But...
Gregory!
Please refrain from interrupting the voting!... you know the rules brother...
AGAINST
President Washington?
FOR
Jacques Péru?
Yes!
And finally, Monsieur de Richet. What is your vote ?
My turn...
VOTE FOR
I vote FOR.
"And while they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.""
VOTE AGAINST
I vote AGAINST.
So be it...
The votes are now cast...
The project is therefore approved...
Dirty... traitor!
Mr Godoy, soon you will be in charge of passing the territory of Louisiana over to France.
It will be done...
What have you done?!
Me? Nothing, dear brother.
So you were not won over by my project. Hmm, that hurts.
I... I warned you!
You di... you didn't want to... listen to me...
Never mind, it will still come to pass.
Traitor! Wh... what have you done?!
You are... you are obliged... to respect your wo... your word...
That is the... the... the rule!
The time of conferences is over, dear brother.
Let us abandon all this charade.
You don't... have... the... right!
What have... you... done... to me?!
What have I done? Nothing, Gregory.
You did it yourself.
A word of advice. In the future - oh, that is if you have one - don't drink someone else's cup of tea without checking what's in it.
Father! What happened?!
Sir Gregory, what's the matter?
William, what have you done?...
Not Now!
You... you are mad, William...
Father will... Father... will... punish you for... for this...
He will probably try...
Unless I get to him first.
But... I cannot... die...
No, you cannot die.
You are however losing all sense of reason...
As well as all your special abilities.
Wh... What... What did... I... drink?
Can't you guess?
There are but few things that can have such an effect on such as we.
You would know that if you ever ventured, even a little way, off of Father's beaten track.
I... revenge...
Oh! No, my dear Gregory.
You will not be taking any revenge. You will die stupidly, alone, enclosed in that rather withered body.
Help... help me... help...
After several centuries of near-absolute power, here you find yourself on your hands and knees, hoping in vain that someone is going to help you. Tell me, what does that feel like?  Never happened to me. Can't be good.
You cannot leave your body, you cannot project yourself elsewhere, you cannot even contact Father. Go ahead, try...
You're just going to bleed to death here in the middle of my lounge.
But you are my brother so I ask you to remember that all this is your own fault, and I want you to understand I get absolutely no pleasure out of it. Well, very little.
Y... you s... swine!
A new order is born today, brother.
Enough of Father's hegemony.
After all these years of servitude, I can finally stand up and oppose it!
You chose to serve him whatever his excesses. Now it's up to you to face the consequences of that choice.
Poor... m... mad!
I... am... stronger than... than you!
My friends, here we are at last, gathered together to close this conference.
I would first of all like to thank you all for making the time to be here and lend your services.
