Dirty... traitor!
Mr Godoy, soon you will be in change of passing the territory of Louisiana over to France.
It will be done...
What have you done?!
Me? Nothing, dear brother.
So you were not won over by my project.
I... I warned you!
You di... you didn't want to... listen to me...
Never mind, it will still come about.
Traitor! Wh... what have you done?!
You are... you are obliged... to respect your wo... word...
That is the... the... the rule!
The times of conferences is over, dear brother.
Let us abandon all this charade.
You don't... have... the... right!
What have... you... done... to me?!
Me? Nothing, Gregory.
You did it yourself.
In the future, that is if you have one, don't drink someone else's cup of tea without checking what's in it.
Father! What happened?!
Sir Gregory, what is the matter?
William, what have you done?...
Stop!
You... you are mad, William...
Father will... Father... will... punish you for... for this...
He will probably try...
Unless if I get him first.
But... I cannot... die...
No, you cannot.
You are however losing all sense of reason...
As well as your abilities.
Wh... What am... I... drinking?
Can't you guess?
There are but few things that can have such an affect on us.
You would know if you ever ventured, even a little way, off of Father's beaten track.
I... revenge...
No, my dear Gregory.
You cannot take your revenge. You are going to die stupidly, alone, enclosed in this withered body.
Help... help...
After several centuries of near-absolute power, here you find yourself on your hands and knees, hoping in vain that someone is going to help you. Tell me, what does that feel like?  It can't be good.
You cannot leave your body, you cannot project yourself elsewhere, you cannot even contact Father.
You are just going to bleed to death here in the middle of my lounge.
But I ask you to remember that all this is your own fault, and that I get absolutely no pleasure out of it.
S... s... swine!
A new order is born today, brother.
Enough of Father's hegemony.
After all these years of servitude, I can finally stand up and oppose it!
You chose to serve him whatever his excesses. Now it's up to you to face the consequences.
Poor... m... mad!
I... a-am st... stronger than... than... you!
