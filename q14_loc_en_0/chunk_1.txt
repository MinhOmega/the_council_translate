Emily?
Come in, Louis...
Oh! God... Louis, your arm! What happened?
Right, so now she notices?
Erm I... I had an accident, but don't worry about it... Really, I'd rather not talk about it.
But... you...
Please...
It would take too long to explain.
Very well then... I shan't insist.
I see you still don't trust me...
Speak to her about the servant
You're not alone?
I've inherited one of Mortimer's personal guards because he's worried about my health.
But don't worry, we can talk. All the servants dressed in black are deaf and dumb.
Don't raise the question
...
I wanted to talk to you about what happened...
I'd rather not, Louis.
What happened in the past is in the past. Talking about it won't change a thing.
Sarah wasn't my mother... She abducted me and lied to me all my life...
We are mere pawns...
I... Louis... About what happened on the wharf, I'm so sorry, really...
I hope you'll be able to forgive me one day...
What's in the past is in the past, right?
I'd rather not talk about it if you don't mind.
You wanted to speak to me?
Yes...
Louis, you have to tell her about the Daemons...
I've got something important to tell you...
About what happened here...
I'm listening...
Mortimer and Holm...
They are Daemons and you are like them...
I know you told me the truth about Mortimer and Holm...
I know they are daemons...
That's not all...
Go on...
I'm like them, Emily. I'm also a Daemon.
I know.
What?... how do you know?
Sir Gregory came to speak to me earlier...
At great length.
I'm his niece, Louis.
I'm Mortimer's child too.
You're my sister?
Surprise!
Er... wh...I... it's... but...
I have a sister...
That's right... and I have a brother.
I didn't see that one coming...
So that means that what we did...
Louis!
I would rather we never mention what may have happened between us, please.
I'm trying very hard not to break down. In just a few days my whole life has fallen apart and I'd like to try to retain some dignity.
Of course...
Emily? Emily, it's me.
Come in, Louis.
I just saw that...
What's that servant doing in your room?
A gift from Father.
You're joking, right?
Unfortunately not.
He's worried about my health.
Ah, typical! Of course I understand this is in no way an overreaction on his part...
Anyway, I've come to see if you're better...
That's very nice of you, thank you.
I'd appreciate it if we kept our last discussion to ourselves, Louis.
I'm not very proud of the state I was in.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
And did you manage to speak to Mortimer?
One moment, I'd rather continue our discussion away from any curious eyes.
Follow me next door, please.
You wanted to know if we spoke?
Well, let's just say he didn't stick around long but yes, I can definitely say we spoke.
What did you talk about?
Do you want to talk about it?
He urged me to change sides and join him.
Ah... that's not what I was expecting...
Yes, you can't say Father allowed himself to get sentimental...
And what did you answer?
And what did you answer?
I don't know. Hard to say.
Yet they've known each other for a long time
But if I remember rightly, you said this isn't the first time you've been entertained here.
You knew each other before, didn't you?
Yes, that's true.
He told me he didn't know the exact nature of our relationship until a short time ago.
And if it will reassure you, I'm generally pretty good at reading people and I can tell when they're lying...
With him, it's impossible to know what's real and what's not.
And how did it go?
And did it go alright?
I imagine you spoke about yourselves?
He confirmed what Sir Gregory told me, that he really is my father...
That he didn't know I was his daughter until a short while ago...
Don't insist
And how are you? Did you take it alright?
To be honest, I don't know.
I feel like I've lost all my bearings.
And what about me then...
