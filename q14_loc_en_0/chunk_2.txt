Emily?
Come in, Louis...
Oh! God... Louis, your arm! What happened?
Hey, now she notices?
I erm... an accident, but don't worry... Really, I'd rather not speak about it.
But... you...
Please...
It would take too long to explain.
Very well then... I shan't insist.
I see you still don't trust me...
Speak to her about the servant
You are not alone?
I've inherited one of Mortimer's personal guards because he's worried for my health.
But don't worry, we can talk. All the servants dressed in black are deaf and dumb.
Don't raise the question
...
I wanted to talk to you about what happened...
I would rather not, Louis.
What happened is water under the bridge. Speaking about it won't change a thing.
Sarah wasn't my mother... She abducted me and lied to me all my life...
We are mere pawns...
I... Louis... About what happened on the wharf, I'm so sorry, really...
I hope you'll be able to forgive me one day...
No use crying over spilled milk.
I don't want to talk about it if you don't mind.
You wanted to speak to me?
Yes...
Louis, you have to tell her about the Daemons...
I've something important to tell you...
About what happened here...
I'm listening...
Mortimer and Holm...
They are Daemons and you are like them...
I know you told me the truth about Mortimer and Holm...
I know they are daemons...
That's not all...
Go on...
I am like them, Emily. I'm also a Daemon.
I know.
But... how do you know?
Sir Gregory came to speak to me earlier...
At great length.
I'm his niece, Louis.
I'm Mortimer's child too.
You're my sister?
Surprise!
I... it's... but...
I have a sister...
That's right... and I have a brother.
I didn't see that coming...
So that means that for us...
Louis!
I would rather not mention what may have happened between us, please.
I'm trying very hard not to break down. In just a few days my whole life has fallen apart and I'd like to retain some dignity.
Of course...
Emily? It's me.
Come in, Louis.
I just saw...
What's the servant doing in your room?
A gift from Father.
You're joking, right?
Unfortunately not.
He's worried about my health.
Typical, of course he's not overreacting...
Anyway, I've come to see if you're better...
That's very nice of you, thank you.
I'd appreciate it if we kept our last discussion to ourselves, Louis.
I'm not very proud of the state I was in.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
And did you manage to speak to Mortimer?
Hang on, I'd rather continue our discussion away from all eyes.
Follow me, next door, please.
You wanted to know if we spoke?
Well, let's just say he didn't stick around long but yes, I can definitely say we spoke.
What did you talk about?
Do you want to speak about it?
He urged me to change sides and join him.
Ah... that's not what I was expecting...
Yes, you can't say Father allowed himself to get sentimental...
You can say that again...
And what did you answer?
That I had to think about it.
[PSYCHO] And how did it go?
And did it go alright?
I imagine you spoke about yourselves?
He confirmed what Sir Gregory told me, that he really is my father...
That he didn't know I was his daughter until a short while ago...
Yet they've known each other for a long time
But if I remember rightly, you said this isn't the first time you've been entertained here.
You knew each other before, didn't you?
Yes, that's true.
He told me he didn't know the exact nature of our relationship until a short time ago.
And if it will reassure you, I'm generally pretty good at reading people and I can tell when they're lying...
With him, it's impossible to know what's real and what's not.
Don't insist
And how are you? Did you take it alright?
To be honest, I don't know.
It feels like I've lost all my bearings.
And what about me then...
