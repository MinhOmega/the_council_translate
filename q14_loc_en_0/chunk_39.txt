Piaggi.
You're the one who killed him...
But... I...
I didn't say anything.
But I know it was you.
So, see you later at the conference, and don't make any more stupid mistakes.
Make sure you vote against Mortimer.
That was my intention anyway, with or without your impotent threats.
They are going to blackmail you
I have been given to believe that they are going to blackmail you into changing your mind and that...
Ha ha ha! You amuse me, de Richet...
They can always try, they will be made welcome!
So you think there is no way they can blackmail you then?
Right, at first this was amusing, now it's becoming ridiculous, Louis.
Just let them try!
Come now, stop wasting my time, I have things I need to do.
I've some important news to tell you.
And above all, try to stay calm.
I want you to know the truth because I see you here among us in total ignorance and it sincerely makes me sad.
What the hell are you talking about, for god's sake?
Ah, Louis, don't start shouting!
Very well, Emily.
Very well, Emma.
I'm sorry, I lost my temper.
What is it you want to speak to me about?
Ah, that's more like it.
Well...
What I wanted to tell you...
Yes?
Is that you might...
I might what?
That you made an error here when you took me for Emily.
What... You...
I am Emma, Louis.
And that's not all.
I'm Mortimer's daughter as well.
We are brother and sister, Louis.
What, wait... But... I...
Oh! And, I am a Daemon.
There, now you know everything.
I feel better for it. I didn't want there to be any lies between us.
How do you feel?
Keep control of yourself, Louis. Keep calm!
Keep concentrated, Louis!
Don't give anything away!
CON-CEN-TRATE!
Alright...
Alright? Are you alright about it?
Of course...
Oh, I was worried you'd take it the wrong way...
Nooo! No, of course not...
Good, I'm glad.
You understand, if we are to move forward together, we have to be able to trust one another.
Move forward?
Of course...
Yes, once we're together.
I've been thinking about it, you know. Once we get back, we won't have to wait long before my poor husband passes...
Then we'll be able to get married.
Excuse me, get married?...
Oh, Louis, I've been thinking of nothing else!
My sister would never have made you happy, you know!
You'll see, I'll take care of everything and we'll be happy, my love.
Yes, o... of course we will.
But tell me, before all that, I... I was just wondering... What about the conference?
Don't worry, I've got everything sorted.
We shall follow Father.
He came to talk to me and persuaded me to join him!
Isn't it wonderful? We'll all be together, as a happy family!
Alright...
Alright, this... this is completly beyond me...
I see that you've thought about everything.
So, I'll just be off to tell Sir Gregory the bad news then...
Excellent idea, my darling!
It's the right thing to do!
See you in a while.
That poor woman is literally broken inside...
I may not be in love with her, but I wouldn't wish that upon anyone.
FILTHY BITCH!!
You're sick!!!
You... You're... a lunatic! You killed your own sister!!
You killed my mother!!
You deserve to end up on the gallows!
That's enough!!
I won't tolerate another word!
OUT!
If you think I'm going to let you get away with this kind of behavior, then you don't know me!
You better pull yourself together if you want me to forgive you!
So, do we agree?
Agreed.
Let's return to our places now.
You're right.
Hmm... what were they talking about?
So, do we agree?
Agreed.
Let's return to our places now.
You're right.
Hmm... what were they talking about?
Louis, a moment of your time, please.
Yes, monsieur.
What can I do for you?
