I'm not convinced by his proposition. I'll be voting for Sir Gregory.
I understand.
In that case, I'll vote for Holm, like you.
But it won't please Father.
That's only to be expected.
But well... it's not my fault if he hasn't been able to convince me.
Don't worry, he'll get over it...
Right, I won't disturb you any further.
See you later for the vote.
See you in a while.
Emma?
Come in, Louis...
What can I do for you?
Well, the conference will be upon us soon, and I've found some more...
And right you are!
I wanted to wait a bit before speaking to you about it but as you are here...
I've been thinking about what we'll do when we get back.
How we ought to decorate the house, prepare the children's bedrooms...
Yes, I want three and the first born will be a boy, we'll call him Louis, after his father.
Oh great, this just keeps getting worse...
She's drifting deeper into madness.
I ought to help her!
Alright, I can't let her be taken advantage of for the sake of this cursed conference.
If Mortimer doesn't help her, then it'll have to come down to Holm!
Emma, listen to me...
Anyway, we'll have time to speak about it later.
Regarding the conference, as we're going to vote for Mortimer's project, I thought to myself, you ought to go and notify Sir Gregory that we won't be following him.
For Mortimer?
But... I thought you weren't on very good terms with him...
True. But he came and spoke to me and...
He... well, I'm not exactly sure but...
I shall vote for Mortimer!
Anyway, go and tell Gregory that we've changed our minds.
Madam, you shouldn't take part in that conference.
What would you say about returning to England?
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
It's not reasonna...
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
I see Father hasn't left her much choice here...
Very well. I'll go and tell Sir Gregory right away.
I'll see you later then, Madam.
I hope Gregory will be able to do something. She really needs help.
Too bad for her!
It's almost a pity but given what she's capable of doing...
I won't feel guilty about taking advantage of the situation!
She wanted to play, and she's lost!
Anyway, we'll have time to speak about it later.
Regarding the conference, as we're going to vote for Mortimer's project, I was thinking, you ought to go and notify Sir Gregory that we won't be following him.
Madam, I doubt that will go down very well with Sir Gregory.
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
I do understand but I don't think that...
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
Ah, right. He's completely turned her...
Let's not stay here any longer, I really don't feel like playing house with this madwoman.
Perfect, I shall go and tell Sir Gregory right away!
Don't crack, Louis. Leave what happened on the wharf behind you and don't let yourself be overwhelmed by anger!
Concentrate on the conference!
Come on, Louis!...
Duchess?
Come in, Louis. You've come at just the right time, my love.
I was about to come and see you.
Am I dreaming or is she making out like nothing ever happened...
I wanted to talk to you too.
Of course, but I shall start.
Emma?
Come in, Louis...
What can I do for you?
Well, the conference will be upon us soon, and I've found some more...
