Anyway, we'll have time to speak about it later.
Regarding the conference, as we're going to vote for Mortimer's project, I was thinking, you ought to go and notify Sir Gregory that we won't be following him.
Madam, I doubt that will go down very well with Sir Gregory.
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
I do understand but I don't think that...
I MUST vote for Mortimer...
Ah, right. He's completely turned her...
Let's not stay here any longer, I really don't feel like playing house with this madwoman.
Perfect, I shall go and tell Sir Gregory right away!
Don't crack, Louis. Leave what happened on the wharf behind you and don't let yourself be overwhelmed by anger!
Concentrate on the conference!
Come on, Louis!...
Duchess?
Come in, Louis. You've come at just the right time, my love.
I was about to come and see you.
Am I dreaming or is she making out like nothing ever happened...
I wanted to talk to you too.
Of course, but I shall start.
I've some important news to tell you.
And above all, try to stay calm.
I want you to know the truth because I see you here among us in total ignorance and it sincerely makes me sad.
What the hell are you talking about, for god's sake?
Ah Louis, don't start shouting!
Very well, Emily.
Very well, Emma.
I'm sorry, I lost my temper.
What is it you want to speak to me about?
Ah, that's more like it.
Well...
What I wanted to tell you...
Yes?
Is that you might...
I might what?
That you made an error here when you took me for Emily.
What... You...
I am Emma, Louis.
And that's not all.
I'm Mortimer's daughter as well.
We are brother and sister, Louis.
What, wait... But... I...
Oh! And, I am a Daemon.
There, now you know everything.
I feel better for it. I didn't want there to be any lies between us.
How do you feel?
Control yourself, Louis. Keep calm!
Keep concentrated, Louis!
Don't give anything away!
CON-CEN-TRATE!
Alright...
Alright? Are you alright about it?
Of course...
Oh, I was worried you'd take it the wrong way...
No! No, of course not...
Good, I'm glad.
You understand, if we are to move forward together, we have to be able to trust one another.
Move forward?
Of course...
Yes, once we're together.
I've been thinking about it, you know. Once we get back, we won't have to wait long before my poor husband passes...
Then we'll be able to get married.
Excuse me, get married?...
Oh, Louis, I've been thinking of nothing else!
My sister would never have made you happy, you know!
You'll see, I'll take care of everything and we'll be happy, my love.
Yes, o... of course we will.
But tell me, before all that, I... I was just wondering... What about the conference?
Don't worry, I've got everything sorted.
We shall follow Father.
He came to talk to me and persuaded me to join him!
Isn't it wonderful? We'll all be together, as a happy family!
Alright...
Alright, this... this is completly beyond me...
I see that you've thought about everything.
So, I'll just be off to tell Sir Gregory the bad news then...
Excellent idea, my darling!
It's the right thing to do!
See you in a while.
That poor woman is literally broken inside...
I may not be in love with her, but I wouldn't wish that upon anyone.
FILTHY BITCH!!
You're sick!!!
You... You're... a lunatic! You killed your own sister!!
You killed my mother!!
You deserve to end up on the gallows!
That's enough!!
I won't tolerate another word!
OUT!
If you think I'm going to let you get away with this kind of behavior, then you don't know me!
You better pull yourself together if you want me to forgive you!
De Richet! I told you that I did not have time for you, I will ask you to leave me alone.
Monsieur Bonapa...
AH! Excuse me, I was expecting someone else.
Monsieur Godoy, do you have a moment?
Your timing's awkward, de Richet, I'm expecting someone.
I haven't time, please leave me.
Very well, I won't insist...
Looks like he only wants to speak to Bonaparte.
I know what I have to do if I want to speak to himÂ !
De Richet! I told you that I did not have time for you, I will ask you to leave me alone.
Monsieur Bonapa...
