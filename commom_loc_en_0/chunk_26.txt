My dear Elizabeth,
Your last letter gave me much cause for concern.
Your words were so cold, as if emotions no longer matter to you.
Father maintains that the secondary effects of your treatment still trouble you.
But that they will soon subside. Should I believe him?
I cling to the belief that we shall soon see each other again. At long last!
Write soon.
Your loving sister, Abigail.
P.S. Don't forget to tell me what present you want.

My dear sister,
The cancellation of our reunion hit me like a stab to the heart.
Father told me it was for your well-being, but I can't help but blame him.
He claims that your condition has worsened and that it could be dangerous for both of us if we met.
If only I knew where you were, believe me, I'd be at your side.
I haven't received any news from you in a long time. Please write.
Your loving sister, Abigail.
P.S. I hope you like the enclosed talisman.

Elizabeth,
I am driven to despair and doubt there is any point in writing to you.
I'm not even sure you receive my letters.
Father controls my correspondence more and more. I am certain he filters our exchanges.
Thankfully, one of the chambermaids is able to help me get my letters to you.
But they still remain unanswered.
I often think about you and pray everyday to be able to hold you tight.
We have so much time to make up. I beg you, answer me, please.
Your loving sister, Abigail.
P.S. That horrible woman came again yesterday. She spent a long time speaking with Father.
I didn't understand everything because they spoke in French, but I'm sure they were talking about you.

Dear E,
I received your last letter; unfortunately the Crown informed the Golden Order that our mission should under no circumstances hamper Sir Gregory's plans.
Decidedly, they have support from the highest level in Buckingham Palace.
So here we both are, hands and feet tied and little room to maneuver.
Keep me abreast of events; our mission is becoming more complicated.
Yours, E.
(P.S. The French chapter of the Order doesn't appear to know anything about the arrival of our friend Sarah. I therefore can not comment on it. However, my guess is that she has come here for personal reasons.)

Dear Gregory,
Thank you for the information. I've managed to find out about the names you gave me.
George Washington is a man you can trust.
In spite of his obvious talent for politics, he has remained upright and honest. On the other hand, as you may well know, he is already doing business with Lord Mortimer. It will be more difficult to approach him.
Napoleon Bonaparte was unknown to me until today. He's a passionate young French soldier for whom Mortimer predicts a promising future.
Take heed, he is a man of conviction, which, to my mind, makes him potentially dangerous.
As for Sarah de Richet, what more is there to say? You already know each other.
She was apparently invited by Lord Mortimer, about an on-going matter in Paris that concerns a receiver in stolen art.
See you soon.
Duchess Emily Hillsborrow

Madam,
I shall never thank you enough for all your care and attention.
