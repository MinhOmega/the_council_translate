I know what it's about!
"What you recovered for me"...
It must be about the Al Azif!
Wöllner told me that he had managed to find it...
Forget it...
Wöllner told me he came in from outside a minute ago...
So he must have accomplished his mission.

Landing stage!
Right, so Wöllner is going to leave AL Azif at the landing stage by the pier.
Leave
A lantern. Nothing special.

Why is his study in such a mess? Looks like Wöllner is planning something...
Why is his study in such a mess? Looks like Wöllner is planning something...
What is...
Yes, yes ! At last I've found it!
Al Azif!!
Well... got to admit, you did give us a run for our money...
Hmm, a page has been torn out.

I know you are trying to find out what happened to Elizabeth...
But it's getting out of hand now... Your escapade on the continent cost me enough as it is!
I know it hasn't been easy for you leaving Elizabeth confined in her room for a month so she doesn't bump into Sarah
But to run away? Without warning! I had to lie to cover you, Johann...
Act as if you arrived separately, only a few days ago and persuade William to do the same with his guests.
I demand that you come to your senses and take hold of yourself.
I asked you to fetch something so we can get it off the island, not for to study it in a vain hope of acquiring power.
It won't give you any answers, let me be clear on that.
At most we run the risk of losing it again.
So, for the last time, please go and leave it at the agreed place.
I can confirm that someone will pick it up immediately.

Look, a blotter... And apparently it's been used recently.
I wonder what Wöllner was going to write.
It's smudged, it's not all legible.
I can make out the signature, though and...
leave...
Az...
Azif...

Lan...
How can I show what's written?
It's illegible... Let's see if I can find a solution in Wöllner's things here...
Given his interest in alchemy, I wouldn't be surprised if I found something that revealed what's written somewhere in his room...

So Wöllner is going to leave Al Azif at the landing stage, isn't he?
Pick up the paper

That's not surprising coming from von Wöllner.

I should find something to help reveal the traces of ink on the blotter...
What might do the trick?
I have to find some ammonium sulfide if I want to make the text appear by capillary action.
Perfect! Here's some...
Think, damn it!
Think, Louis...
