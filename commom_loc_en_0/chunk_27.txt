I shall be indebted to you until my last breath. If you have any request of me, you only need ask.
With regards to my son, William, I shall never thank you enough for looking after him.
You know the latter's preferences and you will understand he needs you desperately.
For that and as agreed with Queen Charlotte, our friend Duke Hillsborrow will carry out his task and meet with you within six months. From then on you'll be free from want.
Yours sincerely,
William Pitt, Count of Chatham.
A letter from William Pitt The Elder addressed to Emily.

A letter from William Pitt the Younger, addressed to Emily.
He's the present Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
Emily has indeed some powerful backers.
Madame,
Thank you for consoling the Queen.
The King's situation is worsening, but I wager he'll recover from this present fit.
Next time you speak with her Majesty the Queen, would you please be so kind as to ask her to look into my petition to raise taxes with the King.
I will personally see to it that our nation will recover from this impasse. But King George's mental situation is slowing down our decision-taking.
Thank you in advance for all your help.

Dear friend,
Who is the most admirable of all the Olympians ? None other than the king of the gods of course.
Unlike his father Chronos, he learnt to make equal use of his strength and wisdom.
Instead of fearing the power of his children and brothers, he accepted to share the world with them.
Men fear his thunder and praise his justice. He reigns but doesn't dominate...

My dear Napoleon,
As previously agreed, I would like to ask you to join us, in January, on my island to participate in the high society meeting organized for the occasion.
We shall be able to continue our discussion about our project for a new order for France.
I have a proposition to make to you concerning your wish to put a strong leader at the head of France.
I trust you to be discreet as to your coming.
See you soon.

My dearest son,
I'm writing to implore you to act quickly.
The situation is rapidly worsening here. Paoli continues to steer our motherland, Corsica, toward open warfare between France and England.
His men are everywhere. We are obliged to go into hiding and are unable to remain in the same place for more than two days. I wouldn't be surprised if they targeted us soon.
Make haste, my son. You hold our destiny in your hands.
Your loving mother,
Maria Letizia Bonaparte

Dear friend,
Please come and join us. We must meet about the on-going operations in Paris.
A boat will be waiting for you in Calais and will take you to Dover, in England.
From there, a carriage will take you to the port of Tintagel where a frigate will be waiting for you, and other guests, so you can meet up with me on my island as quickly as possible.
I await your arrival.

Dear Monsieur PÃ©ru,
I'm writing to thank you for the funds you sent. These funds will be crucial for the renovation of the western wing of the orphanage.
The children you sent are doing marvelously well and little Pierre will soon be walking.
