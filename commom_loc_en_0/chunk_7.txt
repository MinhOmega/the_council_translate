I know for sure that lime water neutralizes chemical actions but doesn't work on ink.
I must find something else.
Ammonium sulfide
That sounds vaguely familiar...
I can always give it a shot...
Here we go!
Maybe not...
Tannic acid of alum
Mother taught me a thing or two on the subject... and this name reminds me of something.
Let's just see how good my memory is...
Here we go!
Maybe not...
Lime water
I... I think I read somewhere that lime water was used on ancient manuscripts...
Let's try it..
Here we go!
Maybe not...
Go back
Royal jelly
Leave
Damn! It's diluted the ink! Now it's illegible!
Right.. it's not my lucky day...
Yes! It worked! Now I can see it...
"Sir Gregory, I'll leave Al Azif at the landing stage at the appropriate time. Yours truly, Johann von Wöllner."
So when Wöllner comes back from the landing stage, the Al Azif might still be there!
This is child's play...
A chemistry set...
That's not surprising coming from von Wöllner.
Chemical products
I should find something to help reveal the traces of ink on the blotter...
What might do the trick?
I have to find some ammonium sulfide if I want to make the text appear by capillary action.
Perfect! Here's some...
Think, damn it!
Think, Louis...

No need to go there for the time being.

Peru leaves his room and goes towards the stairs of the great hall
What can I do for you, sir?
I am at your service, day and night, sir.
What can you tell me about our host?
I would like you to speak about your master, Lord Mortimer.
Do please excuse me, sir, but I shall make no comment about my master.
Is there anything else that sir would like to know?
What can you tell me about the guests?
What can you tell me about the guests?
Do excuse me, sir, but I am bound by discretion to say nothing about Lord Mortimer's guests, sir.
Perhaps sir would like to know something else?
I have a few questions about the manor.
What can I find on the ground floor?
Yes. Can you briefly describe the ground floor, please?
Very well, sir.
On the ground floor, there are mainly living rooms.
Sir finds himself at present in the Grand Hall.
From the Grand Hall, sir can access, on one side, the Small Salon where the guests like to relax with a good book.
From there, sir can access the Conference Room, which is closed at present for preparations.
That is where Lord Mortimer likes to gather all of his guests for talks.
From the other side of the Grand Hall, sir may access the Dining Room.
That is where sir's meals will be served.
From the Dining Room, sir may benefit from an exceptional view overlooking the island.
It is also the best way to access the Portrait Gallery, where a large part of Lord Mortimer's works are exhibited.
And in the gallery, sir will also find access to the Garden.
But sir may be reassured, the building is accessible on both sides, so that it surrounds the Garden in question.
So, sir should not find cause to worry, no one has ever gotten lost.
Except for my mother...
Has Sir another question?
What's on the first floor?
What's on the first floor?
The first floor is reserved for guests, sir. That is where sir will find his private rooms.
The main corridor leads around the building. Three stairways will enable sir to return to the ground floor.
It is also from there that sir will be able to reach the second floor.
Thank you very much.
Anything else, sir?
What is on the second floor?
