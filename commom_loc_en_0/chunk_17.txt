January 23rd, 1793
Elizabeth Adams is the daughter of John Adams, vice president of the United States.</n></n>Elizabeth was rejected by her parents at birth and was declared still-born. Brought up in isolation, she grew into a frail young woman with bipolar disorder, devoured by her terrible fits of anxiety. Her deepest secrets were slowly gnawing away at her from inside.</n>Despite numerous treatments, nothing could cure her, the young woman continued to descend into folly.</n></n>As a friend of Sir Gregory Holm and of Lord Mortimer, John Adams decided to send his daughter to Lord Mortimer's manor in the hope that he could help her.</n></n>With little hope, Elizabeth has now been at the manor for a short while.
Sarah Faustine de Richet is a rich French aristocrat.</n></n>Thirty-four years ago, Sarah took over one of the most important secret societies: the Golden Order.</n>A woman of strong will, Sarah endeavored to infiltrate the highest circles of society. Politics, trade transactions, Secrets of State or paranormal spheres, the Order had an eye over everything.</n>One of the biggest areas of growth that Sarah brought to the Order was the development of its branches in America, Europe and Central Africa.</n>Not to mention the expansion of her occult section, which she took care of personally.</n></n>Since he was just a boy, Sarah has been preparing her son, Louis, to become the new face of the Golden Order.
Emma Hillsborrow is the twin sister of Emily Hillsborrow.</n></n>Living in the shadow of her sister, Emma shares the same identity with her in the eyes of the world. The two sisters linked their destiny in the most intimate way possible. Workplace, boyfriends, lovers, the two sisters shared everything together. This double identity was much appreciated by Charlotte de Mecklembourg-Strelitz, the present queen of England when she asked the two sisters to serve the crown.</n>But with time, Emma had increasingly greater difficulty with her role as a double.</n></n>It is thus tired of her role, that Emma travels to the Mortimer manor as diplomatic representative of England.
Manuel Godoy: Secretary of State and Head of the Spanish Government.</n></n>A favorite of King Charles IV of Spain, Godoy rapidly climbed the political ranks. Lover of Queen Marie Louise Bourbon of Parma, he attracted the envy of Spanish princes. As Secretary of State, he developed and strengthened the Spanish colonial empire, especially in the Americas. A close friend of Louis XVI, King of France, he worked hard for the king's liberation, but in vain. This served to fuel his resentment of the Republican government of France.</n></n>Invited by Sir Gregory Holm, Godoy arrived at Lord Mortimer's manor with the firm intention of calming the expansionist desires of the United States of America on their continent.
Emily Hillsborrow is an English Duchess, close to the English crown.</n></n>Very discreet about her origins, Emily only came onto the political scene after her wedding, that some qualified as a marriage of interest, to an old English aristocrat on the decline. Libertarian, modern, but discreet, she has taken it upon herself to establish close ties with her peers.</n>In a few years, she has become the favorite diplomat of the Queen, which is what probably prompted her prime minister, William Pitt, to take her as private secretary, thus provoking much suspicion and jealousy.</n></n>As a regular visitor, Emily accepted Sir Gregory Holm's invitation to come to Lord Mortimer's island because, for nothing in the world, would she miss one of these famed receptions.
Sir Gregory Holm, Baron of Nottingham, is a very influential British aristocrat.</n></n>Confirmed royalist, Sir Gregory Holm spent his career extending the influence of the United Kingdom throughout the world. From the flourishing East India Company to the Spanish trading posts in America, he stamped his hallmark on key decisions made by the world's pre-eminent economic power. In England, he contributed to the reduction of the national debt and, being very attached to family values, he invested time in the working class, creating charity schools in order to offer a decent education to the “future links in the next industrial revolution”.</n></n>A network-builder, Holm always finds pleasure in attending the social gatherings of his old friend, Lord Mortimer.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer, Marquis of Westfordshire and peer of Great Britain, is an extremely rich English aristocrat, as discreet as he is influential.</n></n>An investor of talent, Mortimer's success in business was masterful.</n>He finished by withdrawing from the public arena and isolating himself more and more often on his private island. A major patron of the arts, he finances a large number of artists in diverse fields and takes great pleasure in bringing together unexpected personalities. He does the same with the greats of this world, men of influence and men of state of the time.</n></n>He regularly organizes social gatherings on his private island, off the coast of England.
Napoleon Bonaparte is a young lieutenant in the French army.</n></n>In his early youth, Napoleon was uprooted from his native Corsica and thus he bore a grudge against the aristocracy, the clergy and the French people who failed to accept him. He joined the French army with the firm intention of making a name for himself and of marking history by proving his true worth.</n>Searching for backing of any kind, he attracted the sympathy and support of Lord Mortimer.</n></n>Invited to the latter's reception, Napoleon intends to prove his value to the world.
Jacques Peru is one of the fathers of the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris.</n></n>During the Terror, he quickly became one of the most worrying figures in all of Paris. He distinguished himself by taking part in the siege of the Bastille and in the capture of Louis XVI, the current King of France. He was involved in the creation of the “Revolutionary Tribunal”.</n>Is he a man of law or torturer? Nobody dares say. This judge of the people has overseen many trials that sent opponents and traitors of the Revolution to the guillotine.</n></n>Peru interrupts his revolutionary activities when Lord Mortimer, his patron, invites him to join the latter's social gatherings.
His Eminence the Cardinal Giuseppe Piaggi is a legate of Pope Pius VI.</n></n>A distinguished speaker, Giuseppe Piaggi worked throughout his career to serve the principles of the Roman Catholic church. A man of science and amateur philosopher, he quickly caught the ear of the Pope who discretely named him Cardinal “In Pectore”. He was thus able to use this relationship of trust to help Pius VI in his difficult mission of guiding the faithful.</n></n>Invited by Sir Gregory Holm, Piaggi is delighted to meet his old friend Mortimer in order to represent the interests of the Holy See.
Servants</n>All Mortimer's servants wear a mask. It is a recurring subject of conversation among the guests; no one knows the true reason.
George Washington is the founding father and first president of the United States of America.</n></n>Washington shared his life between military and political success. Very early on, he was introduced by Sarah de Richet into the upper circles of an influential secret society from France: the Golden Order. He later took the helm of the American branch. Tired of politics, he wanted to retire to his property in Virginia, but that was without taking into account Lord Mortimer, who encouraged him to come out of retirement. On the advice of his friend, he ran for a second term and was successful.</n></n>Invited by Mortimer to his island, Washington likes to attend such social gatherings incognito.
Johan Christoph von Wöllner is the Prussian Minister of Religion.</n></n>A friend of King Frederick William II of Prussia, von Wöllner secretly managed the affaires of State. Former pastor and member of a Masonic Lodge, he had all the time he needed to convert his King to his point of view. Together they opened their own lodge, under the influence of the Rosicrucians.</n>Passionate about the occult sciences and alchemy, he led a war of religion in his country and fiercely combated the ideas of the Enlightenment.</n></n>A friend of Sir Gregory Holm, von Wöllner believes in spiritual alchemy, of which the materia prima is the human soul.
The only son of Sarah, Louis Mauras de Richet is a young Parisian aristocrat.</n></n>Ever since he was a young child, Louis moved in his mother's circles, and so it was natural that on his fourteenth birthday he entered the Golden Order, the secret society headed by Sarah.</n>Precocious, Louis progressed quickly at her side, despite the daily treatment his mother proscribed for his chronic migraines. He climbed the ladder until he was able to assist his mother in occult cases, for which he was particularly talented. As time went by, he became shaped in the image that his mother had held for him.</n></n>Everything pointed to, one day, young Louis becoming the head of the Golden Order.
