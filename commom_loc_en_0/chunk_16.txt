MIND CONTROL
The tremendous power of the daemons allow them to take over a human's body and mind.
At some points of the story you will mentally control another character and immediately reveal all their traits. You will act through them while Louis's body will stay inanimate where you left it. Actions you will be able to undertake through this character will be impacted by their strengths and weaknesses.
CONTROLLED CHARACTER SKILLS
The skills you can use through controled character depend of their personnality.
Skills to which controled character are immune can all be used for free even if Louis did not unlock them. On the other hand, those to which they are vulnerable will be limited to level 1.
{0} immune to {1} : Skill free to use
{0} vulnerable to {1} : Skill level 1
The character you are controlling is immune to this skill. Take profit of this mastery and use it for free.
The character you are controlling is vulnerable to this skill. Its use will be limited to level 1.
