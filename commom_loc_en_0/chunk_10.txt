It is not for consumption.
That's fine, I have no intention of swallowing this remedy.
You see, I generally use it to put the shine back on my shoes.
But maybe you'd rather I ask permission from Lord Mortimer?
Where is he? I'd like to tell him about my shoe problem.
Sir need do nothing of the sort. There is no reason to disturb Lord Mortimer with this small matter.
As you wish.
Here you are, sir. I hope sir will have enough with one bottle as I haven't any more.
Oh I'll make do. It's good of you to get this much.
May I do anything else for sir?

Would you have any Devil's Thorn? Maltese Cross ?
Ah! I still haven't quite recovered after that boat crossing. Would you happen to have any Devil's Thorn, by any chance?
I...  I am sorry, sir, but the Devil's Thorn may be just a plant, but it is also a powerful psychotropic drug that causes undesirable diuretic effects.
I would advise against sir taking any.
I'll take full responsibility; give some to me.
Don't worry, my good man, I know the effects of Devil's Thorn very well.
I've been taking it for years without any adverse effects. I've never had cause to complain, you can believe me.
That is well, sir. Here is sir's herb.
What else can I do for you, sir?
You just have to know how to take it.
You see, tribulus cistoides is from the zygophyllaceae family, very rich in nitrates and potassium chloride.
It was used in India seven hundred years before Christ, my good fellow. And I know nothing better to perk you up.
Oh! As sir wishes. Here is the herb, sir.
May I help you in anything else, sir?
Return
Would you have any Carmelite Water?
A little Carmelite Water would do me a lot of good, could you find me some, please?
Oh, the tonics are under lock and key, sir. Lord Mortimer only allows access to them in cases of emergency.
That's scandalous
What? That's the last straw!
Lord Mortimer himself asked me to take the sea to join him here. I accepted that out of kindness.
The voyage was undertaken in conditions that I prefer not to speak about.
And then, at long last I arrive and...  and you refuse me a simple flask of Carmelite Water?
No, sir...  I...  I...
Your name! Tell me your name!
Er, er, here, sir, your Carmelite Water. Please accept my sincerest apologies.
If sir requires anything else whatsoever, sir has only to ask.
Very well, it is a matter of urgency.
Listen, I suffer from terrible migraines and the voyage by boat has brought on my rheumatism.
So, unless you have anything else to alleviate the pain, please give me some quickly. Thank you.
Oh and...  and the one from Bordeaux, right? I prefer it to the one from Paris.
Immediately, sir. Here. I hope sir will get well again quickly.
Anything else, sir?
Return
Have you got any Amber?
My good fellow, would you have any amber available?
I would, but unfortunately I don't think I am authorized to give it out, sir. I believe it is a precious stone.
Come now, it has no value...
Look, you aren't going to kick up a fuss about a vulgar piece of resin, are you?
Don't believe what they say about amber. It does nothing to warm up infants' bodies, let alone prevent toothache.
And neither does this fossil oleo-resin stimulate fertility, you can believe me.
Thank you for educating me, I didn't know. Here you are, sir.
Does sir desire anything else?
I'll play a trick on him and steal from him...
No point in lying, you know. I know full well you haven't got any.
I would never think of lying, sir, I don't believe I am authorized to give it away, that is all.
Amber, here? I'd be surprised...
Yet, I assure you, sir.
No, you're pulling my leg. I don't believe you.
I wouldn't dare to joke with sir.
Yeah, sure, you're just leading me on. I dare you to show it to me, if you really have some.
Well, then, sir, here is a piece.
Oh...  right. Well, I'm impressed. Can you lend it to me for a minute?
Of course, sir, here.
Wow, I can hardly believe it.
Well, I have other questions.
Of course, sir. But, sir, I believe you haven't given me back the amber, sir.
What? What amber?
The piece I gave to sir.
No, I don't know what you're talking about. You really ought to look after your things. It can't be easy to come across amber in these parts.
Ah...  errm...  well...  does sir desire anything else?

Manuscript
What's that book you're hiding in your jacket?
The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe, sir. And I am not hiding it.
Hand it to me, please.
It is damaged, sir. I would never dare lend sir a book in such a pitiful state, sir. I took it to restore.
I'll take care of it.
Indeed, this masterpiece must not become more damaged.
Let me have it and I'll take care of it personally. I love antiquarian books.
It bothers me somewhat, it isn't sir's job to take care of it, really.
No, but I would love to. You'd be doing me a favor by letting me have it.
In that case, sir, I shall leave it in your care with pleasure.
May I do anything else for sir?
I'll make him believe that it's MY book!
Hang on...  but...  it's mine.
Beg pardon, sir?
It's my book! I'm telling you, it's my book!
With all due respect, sir, I hope sir will understand that I have doubts. You see, I found it in Lord Mortimer's library.
Huh, there you are then! That's exactly where I left it!
I am...  quite put out, sir, I...  don't know what to say.
In that case I suggest you say nothing and hand it over.
But...  I...
Now.
But Sir, I... Very well, sir. Here you are. May sir take good care of it, it is damaged.
And you've damaged it as well? Oh, bravo, bravo!
No, no, I didn't do anything, it wasn't me, sir.
Say pardon.
Pardon me, Sir.
