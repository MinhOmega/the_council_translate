FIND THE ROOM YOU SAW IN YOUR VISION
GO BACK TO BED
HURRY TO ANSWER THE DOOR
FIND THE MEDUSA
FIND A WAY TO SPY ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE OTHER ROOM
LOOK FOR MORE CLUES OR GO TO THE MANOR
LOOK FOR CLUES ON YOUR MOTHER
GO TO BED
GO TO YOUR ROOM
How many times must I tell you? You must never endanger your life for me!
Mother has always had a fascination for Lord Mortimer, but has never wanted to tell me why.
Please understand that we are doing our utmost to find your mother as quickly as possible.
Without your mother, hundreds of men of the cloth would have gone to the guillotine.
All I can tell you is that I'm looking for my sister.
Do you believe your mother capable of torturing a child?
An agreement for cannons. Lord Mortimer assured me that you are to take over the project, on behalf of your mother.
Johann Christoph von WÃ¶llner, Minister of Religious Affairs
And Jacques Peru, a judge on one of the French Revolutionary Tribunals.
You will find that Lord Mortimer is not what one would call conventional, Mr. De Richet.
Monsieur de Richet, I am apprehending you for the murder of Elizabeth Adams.
I do apologize for being late; I had some...  urgent business to settle.
The only thing I can tell you is that Sarah had indeed changed.
In your opinion, why would your mother remain in hiding over several weeks?
You must leave me alone now! I have agreed to everything...  Even to... 
But you do realize your mother will have to accept the consequences of her acts.
I hope that your search will prove successful and bring Sarah back to us soon.
I'll be leaving now because whatever it is you're up to, I do NOT want to know .
Since then, we have become one and the same. We have officially erased the identity of my sister, Emma.
Emily Hillsborrow, the woman with two faces.
Everyone seems to be a little unnecessarily heated. Don't forget where you are, please.
