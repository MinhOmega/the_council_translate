There is a note: "Effects of Sarah De Richet, to be given to her son, Louis".
I should probably take it.

Alright, I've retrieved everything.

I have no space left. I'll retrieve it later.
I have no space left. I'll retrieve it later.
There's nothing here. I'm pretty sure Wöllner hasn't dropped off the Al Azif yet. Maybe I'm too early?
A sack of seeds.
It's unopened, no one seems to have used any.

Looks like the barrel's been broken for quite some time.

What a mess! Looks like Wöllner was interrupted...
Examine the things on the desk
Looks a lot like... straw...
And he's drawn something in a hurry on this sheet...
Look more closely
Straw on his desk... as if to...
As if to protect something fragile... Yes, someone must have packed something away here.
Look at the sketches
I get the feeling that I've seen that somewhere before.
I've seen that before!
Yes... It's definitely a drawing of the lock of AL Azif.
Wöllner must have kept a copy.
I recognize those symbols
I've seen occult inscriptions like this before, they're not very common...
As a matter of fact I've only seen them once before, around the lock of Al Azif!
Can't think...
Go back
Read the letter
I know what it's about!
"What you recovered for me"...
It must be about the Al Azif!
Wöllner told me that he had managed to find it...
Forget it...
Wöllner told me he came in from outside a minute ago...
So he must have accomplished his mission.
Decode the message on the blotter

Landing stage!
Right, so Wöllner is going to leave AL Azif at the landing stage by the pier.
Leave
