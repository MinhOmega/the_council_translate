Some of them still sometimes suffer nightmares about their parents on the scaffold, but I expect they will cease in due course.
Should you decide to send us more, please note that another twenty beds will soon be ready.
The children and myself will never thank you enough.
Long live the Republic, long live France.

Dear Monsieur Péru,
I'm writing to thank you for the funds you sent. These funds will be crucial for the renovation of the western wing of the orphanage.
The children you sent are doing marvelously well and little Pierre will soon be walking.

My dear George,
I'd like to invite you to join me, as planned, at my place.
I have a project to show you. It is time that the United States played a more important role on the world stage.
I understand your reluctance to play with fire.  I know your new country is very young, but rest assured that I would do nothing to jeopardize what we have built together.
I look forward to seeing you soon.
Your friend, William.
