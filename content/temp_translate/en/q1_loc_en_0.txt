Louis, thank you for staying.
Just like you, when I arrived this morning, I found out that Sarah had gone missing. I know your mother well.
Don't worry, Emily is from the English branch of the Golden Order.
And President Washington is, in fact, the leader of the Order in the United States.
I... I didn't know.
Sorry to have made you wait but I didn't want to speak in front of the others.
You did well... Secrecy and discretion are the pillars of our organization.
If I can help in any way at all, please don't hesitate to ask, my lad. And if you have any other questions, now's the time.
Tell me more about this Mortimer
Mother has always had a fascination for Lord Mortimer, but has never wanted to tell me why.
Lord Mortimer is a remarkable man. He is wealthy, and is adviser to the very highly placed.
Your mother is the head of the Order in France, it doesn't surprise me that he asked her to come.
Lord Mortimer greatly contributed to financing my electoral campaign, for example.
But, I want this to be clear, without ever seeking to gain an advantage!
And that is to his credit.
Yes. You can trust him. He will do everything in his power to help you find Sarah.
Where does Emily know my mother from?
And you Emily, what do you think of my mother?
I only know her through the Order.
The one time we met, we only exchanged a few words, in a corridor of parliament.
And was the exchange courteous or impassioned?
I'm not sure if I understand...
Was there any reason for her to be angry with you?
Under other circumstances I would slap your face for even asking. But I'll put your lack of tact down to her disappearance.
Know that your mother is a woman I would love to work with. Her reputation is entirely deserved.
Mr Washington will be able to tell you more.
Mr Washington, you seem to be very familiar with my mother.
How did he come to know her?
Where did you first meet her?
I met Sarah during the War of Independence, on American soil.
She was introduced to me by a mutual acquaintance, and I must say that her sound advice prevented me from making some terrible mistakes.
She may not be a soldier, but believe me, she deserves a statue as much as Lafayette does.
Whoa, I didn't see that one coming... There's no doubt, mother has many secrets that are still hidden.
When did he see her for the last time?
When did you last speak to her?
Philadelphia, fifteen years ago, Sarah often went back and forth between France and the United States.
Yes, I remember those days, I didn't see her too often.
Right. Would it be too much if I asked you a few more questions?
Not at all, go ahead. But I can't promise I'll remember everything.
May I ask, when you saw each other, what did you talk about?
Rather political?
So my mother was with you during the American Revolution. Did you talk about politics?
Yes. In spite of her young age, she defended our cause with enthusiasm.
Did she go to the front-line like your famous gunner, Molly Pitcher?
Yes, in a way...
The role given to women in your war was a great step forward.
Louis, I am impressed. Few people know about the legend of Molly.
So you don't know the true story.
Molly Pitcher is a character invented by Sarah.
She persuaded me to use a heroic female figure, an American Joan of Arc, if you will.
It enabled us to gain a few thousand extra fighters. And it was all thanks to your mother.
I... I... I... I didn't know that.
Or the mysteries that surround us?
My mother has always been fascinated by strange powers. Did she talk to you about anything like that?
Yes. Her facility for discerning truth from rumor served me well.
Such as preventing massacres, like the one at Salem, from happening again.
Or convincing people that horsemen cannot ride around without heads.
What was it that she used to say now?
Keep an open and logical mind?
Yes! That's it!
Or the Golden Order perhaps?
When she came to the U.S., did you exchange ideas about the Golden Order?
Exactly, what's more, she was essential in helping set up the American branch of the Order.
I would never have become its leader without her help.
We are a new country.
And to achieve our democratic ideals, we need to count on discreet powers such as our organization.
Thank you, sir.
I was hoping to speak with Lord Mortimer. At least now I have some information, thanks to you.
I repeat, Lord Mortimer is a man of his word. You won't be disappointed.
And I am persuaded that your mother's research is his main concern.
Do the others in the Order know, do you think?
Mother still is at the head of the Golden Order.
I find it difficult to believe that she came to this island without notifying the other members.
As for myself, I did not know.
I am here at the request of Sir Holm - a situation regarding the Crown of England to resolve. And to see what Lord Mortimer has to propose to us.
As for me, Lord Mortimer asked me here to speak about the future of America. I did not know that your mother would even be among us.
In any case, no one has yet mentioned associating the Order.
We haven't found many clues yet.
Show the book found on the quay
But I did find a book that belongs to my mother.
Where did you find it?
That's what worries me. I found it hidden on the wharf.
Do you think she was preparing to discretely leave?
I don't know.
Don't speak about the book
And what if Mother has left the island?
I wonder if Mother is still on the island. Could she not have taken a boat and left?
I don't see how.
No vessel can moor closer than two-hundred yards.
Not to mention the permanent presence of staff and servants.
There is one strange thing, I grant you.
This island is barely the size of Delaware and despite that, no one has been able to locate your mother.
So my mother still must be on the island.
An extremely likely proposition.
I'll believe it when I see it.
Don't worry, Louis, I'm sure nothing bad has happened to her.
Yes, I... I hope not.
Louis, thank you for staying.

Don't worry, Louis, I'm sure nothing bad has happened to her.
Yes, I... I hope not.
So, let's go through this: my mother's been hiding pieces of bread between the rotten boards of a wharf, in the middle of the night.
That's not normal. And if that weren't enough, looks now like she's armed.
Meanwhile, she also takes the time to send out letters, reassuring whoever might be interested, that she's having a fabulous time here.
So odd... so very odd. And that's not even all I've noticed. But maybe I ought to move on to the manor now. They'll be waiting for me.
At least, I hope so.

My friend, I hope our dear Giovanni is well.
Aaah, the troubles in France have fatigued him but he will recover slowly, do not fear.
He apologizes for remaining in Rome. The voyage was too much for him.
And right he was, too. The mildness of the Mediterranean, heh?
Remember the name
Giovanni... Braschi?
Am I dreaming or are they talking about Pope Pius VI?
Come, sit down and have something to eat, my friend, you look rather pale.
Excuse me, sir, I have been neglecting my duty.
I haven't introduced myself. Sir Gregory Holm. An old friend of Lord Mortimer's.
A real pleasure, Sir.
You, who must be well used to the court of France, how do you find this peaceful little heaven?
Charming, if I hadn't come here for disturbing reasons.
Yes, I heard the news. What a story!
Indeed, I wanted to ask you:
What is the story exactly?
Would you have any information about the disappearance of my mother?
Er, very little, I'm afraid, my young friend. Your mother came at the invitation of Lord Mortimer.
Then one fine day... we couldn't find her anywhere.
That's it?
As I said, I... I don't know very much. Lord Mortimer had the entire area searched immediately.
We found no clue as to her disappearance.
But I am convinced that as soon as Lord Mortimer becomes available, he will explain the situation.
Does he know my mother?
You seem to know my mother well. Is that true?
Who does not know of her, sir? She has such a wide circle that everyone knows your mother from a distance or close up.
Everyone knows Sarah, my son.
But you only know her by her reputation?
I remember she once worked for the crown of England and that she always honors her engagements.
However, we have never been personally introduced... Sadly.
Well, if I'm to believe my vision, you're not going to get along with her.
Thank you for your answers, Sir Holm.
But... I beg your pardon... I get the impression I know you. Have we met?
Except in my dreams, of course.
Not that I remember, young man.
Er, perhaps you are mistaking me for another member of the Chamber of Lords? What with the wig and the powder, it wouldn't be the first time.
No, you are definitely the one I saw threatening my mother!
I thought... Never mind, it'll come back to me.
Would you allow me one last question, Sir? I don't want to take up all your time.
Oh please, go ahead. Er, what do you want to know?
What did my mother come here for?
Do you know the reason for my mother's presence here?
I haven't the slightest idea, no. She was invited by Lord Mortimer.
But you don't know why?
Not really. I was given to understand that your mother was looking for something.
And do you know how long my mother and Lord Mortimer have known each other?
Several years, I believe, they seemed to know each other for quite a while.
But it was the first time that Lord Mortimer had invited her to join us here.
Good! And finally, would it be possible for me to speak with Lord Mortimer this evening?
I'm terribly sorry, no. He really is quite unavailable.
But please rest assured that everyone is doing their best to find your mother.
All the same, it's not the Chateau de Versailles. It can't be that difficult to find her.
Worry not, my son, I am persuaded that we shall find the famous Sarah De Richet, no doubt with new adventures to share huh, hahaha.
What is the link between Hillsborrow and my mother?
Sir, do you know Emily Hillsborrow?
Oh, Madame la Duchess? Of course! It was I who invited her to the island.
In addition to mutual business we wanted to talk about, I absolutely wanted to introduce her to Lord Mortimer.
Do you know of any link between her and my mother?
Not really, no. They may well have met at the Court of King George, but I can't be sure about that.
No dispute between them, then?
Not to my knowledge, no.
And even if duchess Hillsborrow is a complex woman to understand, I honestly can't imagine her in a conflict with the famous Sarah De Richet.
Who could have held a grudge against my mother?
Could my mother have had a problem with someone during her stay here?
No, not at all, your mother has always been charming company and everyone got on very well with her.
Not even a servant?
Hu! Certainly not.
Everyone gets on well with the famous Sarah De Richet, my boy.
Is there anyone else missing other than my mother?
Do you know if anyone else has gone missing recently?
Not at all, sir. It's as if Sarah has purely and simply vanished into thin air.
That's right, just take me for an idiot, why don't you!
Not even a servant then?
Not even a servant. I can assure you we would have been informed.
Keep your faith, my son, only the celebrated Sarah De Richet could vanish before our very eyes! And she will reappear! You will see...
Elizabeth!
I should have insisted that you rest in your room.
Do you want me to call someone?
Wait there, I'll take care of it!
Let me handle this, I'm used to this kind of thing.
Thank you, Mr De Richet.
Miss, can... can you hear me?
Leave... me …  
Quick diagnostic
Slight arrhythmia. Nothing too serious.
Do you often feel faint?
Leave me alone !
Yes, Elizabeth suffers from poor health. Her fits are part of her daily life.
I would guess it's more like an anxiety attack.
As if something had suddenly terrorized her.
She reeks of laudanum, though.
Are you receiving any regular medical treatment, miss?
Miss Adams?... Are you receiving any medical treatment?
No, I …
I don't know what you have to be afraid of yet, miss, but trying to drive out your demons with drugs won't do much good.
Notice something strange
It's just a dizzy spell, don't worry, you'll be alright.
Her heart rate is already becoming more stable.
Wow... poor girl's had her hands tattooed.
I've seen these pentacles before, in old occult books from the end of the twelfth century.
I don't know what that young woman's trying to protect herself from, but she definitely takes it seriously.
I'm... so sorry, I …
Let her breathe!
Stand back, please, so she can breathe.
Elizabeth is accustomed to this kind of thing.
It looks like it's just a dizzy spell.
Observe the young lady.
Her breathing is becoming stable and...
Her heart rate too.
Pale complexion, thin, broken nails, an enormous scar on her temple. Tattoos on her hands.
I don't know what happened to you, missy, but it looks like you've been through hell.
Don't get involved!
I'd rather not get involved, either.
Just sit there a moment, it'll pass.
She's slowly recovering.
These fits of hers are quite worrying to see, but normally there are no consequences.
No consequences? Have you seen the state she's in?
Can you tell me something about her?
Who is she?
Who... who is this young lady?
Elizabeth Adams. She's come to the island for a course of treatment, to rest.
For a course of treatment?
That's right. The sea air can do wonders.
What's wrong with her?
The dizzy spell is harmless but her general condition is frankly alarming.
You seem to know her. What is she suffering from?
I don't know exactly but her father sent her to us in the hope that she would recover all her faculties.
It would appear she suffers from episodes of dementia.
Is she aggressive?
Sometimes, but only toward herself. She has never hit out at anyone else, I can assure you of that.
She wasn't like that this morning. Something must have upset her.
That's one way to put it.
The poor girl is exhausted but... that's not the cause of her problem.
What is she doing here?
She needs a doctor. Why precisely is she here?
She's the daughter of one of Lord Mortimer's friends. He sent her here so she could be helped.
I didn't know Lord Mortimer was a doctor.
Not in the sense you understand, but he has been practicing alternative medicine for a very long time.
The poor child has already been treated by all the medical doctors her father could find. But no one has been able to cure her.
Elizabeth is beyond the reach of traditional medicine, Mr De Richet.
You all right, Elizabeth? Do you feel any better?
When did she arrive?
Four days ago.
Ok, my mother had already gone missing.
Observe Elizabeth's pendant
She just regains consciousness and she immediately reaches for her broach.
I don't know exactly what it means to her but obviously it's got to be something important.
Take it easy, miss.
Are you alright, Elizabeth? You gave us quite a fright.
Let me... I just need to get back to my room.
Of course, my dear. Go ahead.
You saw it, didn't you?
Pardon me?
I segni della bestia.
Translate
"The sign of the Beast"...
He's referring to the tattoo on her hand.
Yes, Your Eminence... I saw it. I don't know what the young woman has been through but she is marked for life.
It is the least one can say. You know the meaning, don't you?
Protection against the Evil One.
It is a rare practice reserved for cases of possession, Louis. I have seen it during exorcism.
Sorry, Your Eminence, um, I... don't speak Italian.
Ah, forget it, it doesn't matter.
Gentlemen, it's getting late.
It is time for everyone to go to bed. It has been a long day.
My friend, I hope our dear Giovanni is well.
Aaah, the troubles in France have fatigued him but he will recover slowly, do not fear.

It is the least one can say. You know the meaning, don't you?
Protection against the Evil One.
It is a rare practice reserved for cases of possession, Louis. I have seen it during exorcism.
Sorry, Your Eminence, um, I... don't speak Italian.
Ah, forget it, it doesn't matter.
Gentlemen, it's getting late.
It is time for everyone to go to bed. It has been a long day.
You can run if you want to, Sarah! But you will pay for what you've done!
Louis, are you alright?
What's going on?
Oh... You …
Here, take this.
I'm sorry.
Keep it.
Are you better?
I'm fine, don't worry.
It's getting late, why don't... why don't you go on ahead and... I'll catch up with you, ok?
Are you sure?
YES!... I'm sorry. I'm sure, yes.
I definitely have to find Mother quickly.

Are you sure?
YES!... I'm sorry. I'm sure, yes.
I definitely have to find Mother quickly.
Careful, they are coming back.
It's all the more delicate.
I'll see what I can do. But the case I'm on at the moment might well leave me with very few opportunities.
Well, I am impressed with all this splendor.
Don't spend too much time with Mr Washington, my dear, or you'll lose your pretty accent. Hahaha.
Sir, you seem to be intrigued by that statue.
Absolutely. It is remarkable.
They were not talking about that!
Oh, it's naughty to tell lies.
Bet my life you were talking about something totally different from the decoration of the manor.
But to find out what, I should have stayed with them. Too bad!
Lord Mortimer is fond of atypical works of art. I won't disguise the fact that I find it all a little megalomaniacal.
But I must say he does have some outstanding pieces.
Indeed, some of them surprise me.
The statue is impressive, and so are the paintings.
Rubens, Le Caravage, Gagnereaux... Lord Mortimer has very good taste. And the means to express it.
Oh, I see our young sir is a connoisseur.
Yes, in my spare time. Yet, I couldn't tell you who the artist of that painting there, is. I think I recognize a theme, but the style intrigues me.
Saturn Devouring His Son. Oh well, you wouldn't know... the artist is none other than Lord Mortimer.
I thought for a long time that the painting wasn't finished, but my old friend assured me it was. Still, there's no accounting for taste.
Not very conventional but it sure does hold your attention.
You will find that Lord Mortimer is not what one would call conventional, Mr De Richet.
Sir Holm, who was that young lady with you?
Elizabeth Adams, Mr President.
She would have liked to have stayed with us but the poor thing is exhausted.
Elizabeth Adams?
Study the reaction of Washington
Just mentioning Elizabeth totally changed Washington's attitude.
Looks like he just saw a ghost.
Miss Adams is here to rest.
You have perhaps already come across her in the corridors? She arrived a few days ago.
I perceived her but we weren't introduced.
Rest assured, she's not here for the same reasons as yourselves. Consequently, I'm counting on your indulgence.
Examine Holm
Washington looks surprised.
But Holm doesn't seem to see it.
I wonder if he's being polite or if he really doesn't see his discomfort.
On that note, it's very late, you must be exhausted. The servant will accompany you to your rooms.

This wharf is used as storage for a lot of barrels.
Examine the broken barrel
Uh-oh. What have we here?
It's cannon powder.
Examine the cannon powder
The powder is wet. Not surprising, given the dampness of the dock.
It's unusable now.
I don't know what the person who left this barrel like this had in mind, but it's a waste.

Hey, there's something not right about this floorboard. It's different from the rest.
Examine
Somebody replaced it recently. But looks like it's fixed pretty solidly in place. It's going to be tough to rip it out of there.
Rip up the floorboard
There we go.
Take the floorboard out
Shit! It's not coming up. I'll never manage it bare-handed.
I need something to lever it up with.
Use the rusty iron bar
That does it.
Stand back
Let's see what's hidden inside...
There's a book, and also a bag.
The Mysterium Cosmographicum. I know that book well.
Mother used to read passages from it to me all the time.
And judging from what I can see, it's the same one as hers.
For crying out loud, what's happened to you, Mother?
Let's look inside the bag.
A little food, a few toiletries, a small key and some kind of black powder..
Examine the food
Some fruit, a piece of bacon and some bread.
The fruit's still firm.
The bread's a bit stale.
And there's not much left of the bacon.
From the smell, this food has been here roughly two days.
And if it's rationed, there's enough left to last two more days.
Examine the personal belongings
Shit, those are definitely my mother's things.
I recognise her hairpins. And this bag smells of her perfume.
A piece of soap, some oils and her powder puff.
But what does all this mean?
Examine a rusty key
An iron key, completely rusted.
Take the key
You never know, it might be useful. I hope Mother wasn't counting on it.
Leave the key
I'd rather leave it all as it is.
Examine the powder
The bottom of the bag is covered in black powder.
And judging by its consistency, it's the same type of powder that I found earlier.
This just gets better and better...
Take the bag
Right, just in case, I'll take it all. I'll give it back to Mother when I see her.
Stand back
Right, that's enough.
I think I'd better leave her bag here. If she hid all this, it's because she thought she might need it later.

For crying out loud, why did you hide supplies in the middle of nowhere, Mother?
I don't know what's going on here, but you obviously feel like you're in danger.

Louis, during the trip, I had something I wanted to ask you  but we didn't happen to run into each other...
Yes, Duchess?
I'm not sure if you remember, but we've met before.  At that time you were of two minds as to your choice of career.
Tell me, what have you been up to since?
A lantern. Nothing special.

Well, my friends, I am bone-tired. I am off to my bed. See you in the morning.
Good night, sir, I shall do likewise.
Louis, I shall see you in the morning. Sleep well.
Good night, see you tomorrow.
Oh man, it's been quite a day.
Right... Where is my room?

Impossible to set foot on the island without being seen from three-hundred meters away.

I found clues about my mother on the docks
I went up to the manor
I met Mr Washington
I chose to join Sir Holm in the Small Salon
I remained in the Grand Hall to speak with Mr Washington
I found a strange book on the quay
I didn't pick up the book on the quay
I noticed a strange talisman around Adams' neck
I asked questions about my mother
I observed Sir Holm
I pieced together my mother's movements when on the docks
I did not find all the clues about my mother on the docks
I convinced Piaggi to trust me with his letter

Lord Mortimer certainly has a taste for staging rooms.
Lord Mortimer certainly has a taste for staging rooms.
Well, over the last few years I've solved a number of crime cases.
Like the Chauffeurs d'Orgères for example. Thieves that tortured their victims with burning embers.
Hmm, charming... How did you catch them?
I told the most cowardly one that the others had given him up.
Ah! And I wager your thief suddenly started to talk.
You wouldn't believe it. He told us everything. The jobs, the stashes, the names of his partners. Couldn't shut him up.
I heard about that case but I didn't know you were the one who solved it.
Hmm, I'm flattered that the news made it across the Channel. And you've got a darn good memory, Duchess.
Well, I've devoted myself to the interests of France to the best of my abilities.
A few years ago, I had a brush with some of your fellow countrymen.
Counter revolutionaries, I'd imagine.
Exactly. They got away, thanks to a little diversion I came up with to keep the sans-culottes away.
Believe me, they came close to adorning the walls of the Catacombs of Paris.
So that young French diplomat was you?
The mercy you showed the agents of the Queen roused the admiration of the Court.
Few would have let them leave France alive.
Duchess, I'm surprised that anyone still remembers.
I have been involved in all sorts of unsolved cases.
Have you ever heard of the abbey of Hexham?
Er, vaguely.
An ingenious scam involving mass manipulation, on a scale never seen before.
Hmm... there was a cavern under the abbey, wasn't there?
Exactly. The wind would blow in through spouts, creating a... a terrifying howling sound.
So, to stop the howling, the priest called for offerings from the peasants.
And if they brought enough money, I'm guessing the priest stopped the howling. A perfect trick to fool simple souls.
Admit it, Duchess, that story kept you in suspense, didn't it!
... Yes, it did. I'm delighted to find out that you were the young and brilliant French investigator.
For someone who only remembers the case vaguely, your memories are very clear.
Well, they say I have the memory of two people. But please, call me Emily.
Fine, Emily.
Tell me, I was actually helped on that case by my mother. You wouldn't know her by any chance?
Wait, Louis...
We've already met. You do remember me, don't you?
Not at all, so lie to her!
How could I forget a woman such as yourself?
A woman such as me? What a sweet-talker you are. Remind me of how we met.
The most probable place would be... Paris?
Don't you remember? We bumped into each other at Mesmer's show in Paris.
The fraudster had even bamboozled the marquis of Lafayette!
You too apparently, because I've never been to see him!
Ouch! Well, that didn't work!
Chat her up, it”ll make her lose her train of thought
Oh, Emily. I am marked for life.
I'm sure you leave your mark on every man who crosses your path.
Pardon?
That extravagant uniqueness, with its rare blend of whimsical banality and cat-like curiosity.
There's a veil of mystery around you that only adds to your charm and your curves. You would enchant any man.
Hold it, Louis, you've lost me there...
It's as though you have several women hidden inside you, Emily.
I mustn't share my true feelings about you, If I ever dared, I... I'd..
No, dare not, Louis. Better that way.
You go and take a deep breath, and we'll forget all about it.
Heh heh, why Emily, you've gone all red. Are you... are you blushing?
Pretend to be hurt for her not believing you
Emily, it hurts me that you could doubt my sincerity.
I thought we'd gotten over that stage by now.
Don't take it like that, Louis. I was only joking.
I thought you were making fun of me.
I... I thought you were someone I could trust, I'm hurt to see that you're still at the stage of testing me, Duchess.
Listen, Louis, I am sorry. I really didn't want to hurt you.
Forget what I just said, it was clumsy of me.
If you say so.
Let's go with that then. Didn't see me, didn't know me. Push any harder and I'll make a fool of myself.
Not at all, sorry.
Please excuse me, Madame, I'm sure we've met before but I don't remember where.
Hmm, I appreciate your honesty even if it's not very flattering for me.
I imagine that with your beauty, Madame, it's the first time a man hasn't remembered your face.
Well, I must say you make up for yourself rather elegantly.
Please stop torturing me, I am completely at your mercy. Where have we met?
Four years ago in London.
No, sorry, I don't remember.
In the office of William Pitt... Remember? No?
I am so sorry, Emily, but I really don't remember you.
Let's drop it, Louis, it doesn't matter.
Right, time to go to the manor.
She dodged the question about my mother
I ask her a question, she answers with another.
Is she playing with me?
Emily, please excuse my insisting, but you still haven't answered about my mother. Do you know her?
You'll see Louis, everybody here knows Sarah de Richet.
I'm heading off, don't get left behind.
I'm coming.
I don't know where we're going like this, Emily, but you're connected to my mother one way or another.
And if I can believe my vision, you don't have much of a place in her heart.
Well, over the last few years I've solved a number of crime cases.

Well done, Mother.
You just had to pick up Von Borchert's trail on your own, didn't you?
You ditch me in Paris, with no explanation, and off you go to infiltrate one of the world renowned receptions of this Lord Mortimer.
And now he writes me to say that you've gone missing on his private island.
Which, by the way, looks more like a big rock than a paradise island.
The least he could do is explain to me how he managed to lose you.
In any case, it is time for you to stop all this, mother. It no longer suits your age.
Well, I'm sure I will find you once again, slogging through the caves beneath the island...
... Searching for some long lost mystical object, that you just can't live without.
I'm already hating this trip, and all I've done is think about it.

Your Eminence, how was the crossing for you?
As well as can be, Duchess.
But tell me, who invited you?
Contrary to what one may be able to imagine, it was not the host himself who invited me.
Well now, Duchess, we find ourselves both invited by Sir Holm.
Well, how very amusing. Perhaps we have some common interests, your Eminence?
Is this your first time at one of Lord Mortimer's legendary parties?
Oh no. We have been friends since long ago. But as I'm doing some business with Sir Holm, the invitation came from him.
Well, I simply can't wait for all the festivities to begin.
And you, good sir, what brings you here?
Business with Lord Mortimer
Lord Mortimer asked me to join him. We have some business to take care of.
Oh, how mysterious! You adapt quickly, my son. You'll get along here like a fish in water.
Would you believe that we are all here hoping to solve our personal issues? You'll see.
Right. I doubt that you came here to look for your mother, your Eminence.
Personal reason
Your Eminence, with all due respect, I prefer to keep my reasons for coming here to myself.
I promise, it has nothing to do with the legendary party that you all appear to be preparing for.
Believe what you will, my son. However, everything is related to the legendary parties organised by our host.
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that, Cardinal.
Anyway, consider yourself fortunate, young man, because there are many who dream of simply one day setting foot on this island.
And only a very few ever make it.
Indeed, I imagine this must be your first time here?
Absolutely...
That's right. Until now, I've never been invited by Lord Mortimer.
You'll see, you won't soon forget it.
Given what I've seen so far, I wish I'd been passed over.
Turn the question back to the Duchess
And you, Duchess? You seem to be quite accustomed to things here. Am I right?
I do not think that one can ever get accustomed to what Lord Mortimer prepares for his guests.
But, you are right, this is not the first time I've been on this wharf.
If you've come back again, I imagine you must find it to be of some interest.
Here, everything is possible if you make the right choices. It really is up to you whether you leave better off or not.
Please excuse me if you find me overly curious, young man. I did not mean to cause you any embarrassment.
Come Duchess, they are waiting for us.
We're moving, Monsieur de Richet. If you would like to join us.
I'm coming, Duchess.
A cardinal. A Duchess. I wonder if all the guests here are this prestigious.
If I had known, I... I would have gone for a better suit.
Your Eminence, how was the crossing for you?
As well as can be, Duchess.
But tell me, who invited you?
Contrary to what one may be able to imagine, it was not the host himself who invited me.
Well now, Duchess, we find ourselves both invited by Sir Holm.
Well, how very amusing. Perhaps we have some common interests, your Eminence?
Is this your first time at one of Lord Mortimer's legendary parties?
Oh no. We have been friends since long ago. But as I'm doing some business with Sir Holm, the invitation came from him.
Well, I simply can't wait for all the festivities to begin.
And you, good sir, what brings you here?
Business with Lord Mortimer
Lord Mortimer asked me to join him. We have some business to take care of.
Oh, how mysterious! You adapt quickly, my son. You'll get along here like a fish in water.
Would you believe that we are all here hoping to solve our personal issues? You'll see.
Right. I doubt that you came here to look for your mother, your Eminence.
Personal reason
Your Eminence, with all due respect, I prefer to keep my reasons for coming here to myself.
I promise, it has nothing to do with the legendary party that you all appear to be preparing for.
Believe what you will, my son. However, everything is related to the legendary parties organised by our host.
Yeah, I'll be the judge of that, Cardinal.
Anyway, consider yourself fortunate, young man, because there are many who dream of simply one day setting foot on this island.
And only a very few ever make it.
Indeed, I imagine this must be your first time here?
Absolutely...
That's right. Until now, I've never been invited by Lord Mortimer.
You'll see, you won't soon forget it.
Given what I've seen so far, I wish I'd been passed over.
Turn the question back to the Duchess
And you, Duchess? You seem to be quite accustomed to things here. Am I right?
I do not think that one can ever get accustomed to what Lord Mortimer prepares for his guests.
But, you are right, this is not the first time I've been on this wharf.
If you've come back again, I imagine you must find it to be of some interest.
Here, everything is possible if you make the right choices. It really is up to you whether you leave better off or not.
Please excuse me if you find me overly curious, young man. I did not mean to cause you any embarrassment.
Come Duchess, they are waiting for us.
We're moving, Monsieur de Richet. If you would like to join us.
I'm coming, Duchess.
A cardinal. A Duchess. I wonder if all the guests here are this prestigious.
If I had known, I... I would have gone for a better suit.
A rusty old iron bar.
Looks like a bar from an old gate.
This miserable old bar has been broken fairly recently. The edges are still clean.
And the tip is blackened. Without analysis to the contrary, I'd put my money on cannon powder.
Take the bar
This might just come in handy.
Leave it

A letterbox. If there was one place I didn't expect to find a letterbox, this is it.
The servants on the island must use it to prepare the mail before it's sent to the mainland.
Let's see what's hidden inside...
Find a clue
Ah! One of the letters is stamped with the seal of the Order.
And I'd recognise your handwriting anywhere, Mother!
But who is this Samuel Riter Dauchois, who are you writing to?
I don't recognise the name.
Examine the letters one at a time
Let's look...
To Mister Carl Corey
It's too badly written, I can't make out the address.
The envelope has ideograms on it.
Hmm, a letter written in an oriental language.
I know that language
This letter is in Japanese, it's... it's addressed to a certain K. Shotaro, in Tokyo.
I don't know this language.
I haven't the slightest idea what it says.
To Mr R. Galbraith
The address is 50 Bedford Square, London.
To Mr Joaquina da Silva Xavier
The addressee is in Sao Paulo, Brasil.
That reminds me, it's about time the Order sent some envoys there.
Examine the other letters
To Mr P. V. Hoeven
Probably a Dutchman.
To His Eminence Giovanni Angelico Braschi
This envelope is meant for the Vatican.
I know this name
Apparently, this letter is meant for Pope Pius VI. Born Giovanni Braschi.
I wonder which one of these people is influential enough to write to the Pope in person.
Doesn't ring a bell.
This name sounds familiar... Braschi, Braschi... No, can't seem to place it.
To Mr Samuel Riter Dauchois
Name rings a bell.
Samuel Riter Dauchois... Haha! Mother, you test me even when you're not here.
It's an anagram of Louis Mauras de Richet!!
You wanted to write to me then.
Look at the sender's address
Hôtel de Cluny, rue des Mathurins, Paris.
I guarantee this letter is from my mother. The address is a hideout for the Golden Order.
If you write anyone over there, you have to watch out in case someone's reading your mail.
But, who is this Samuel Riter Dauchois?
Nothing special.
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
To Mr H. B. de la Bath
An address in Cairo, Egypt. Mortimer communicates with the whole world, apparently.
Go back to the first letters
Stand back
Back
Stand back
Let's see what's inside this letter.
So...
“Dear Samuel, my stay on Lord Mortimer's island is going wonderfully well.
As I find myself in such charming company, I plan to stay a few more weeks.
Would you be so kind as to send me a gift that I'd like to give to our old friend Manuel Godoy? I would be most grateful.
I have been told that he is going to join us here soon, I would like to mark the occasion.
Thank you in advance. Yours devotedly, Sarah Faustine de Richet.”
What is your game here, Mother?
What are these strange turns of phrase? I've never heard you speak like that. What's going on here?
That you write to me under a pen name, okay. But here you go even further by trying to avoid raising any suspicions should anyone else read it.
I wonder if this Godoy is the person you came looking for.
Secrets, always more secrets!
You never talked to anyone using langage like this! Something's going on here!
Who is this Samuel Riter?
And, for crying out loud, who is this Manuel Godoy that you keep bringing up?
Think. Godoy, Godoy... Manuel Godoy... Why does the name sound so familiar?
Ah, yes, I remember now!
Ah, it's coming back to me. Godoy is the head of the Spanish government. He was appointed by King Charles IV, if I'm not mistaken.
Rumor has it that he's very close to the Queen. Too close.
Much... too close. But hey, that's none of my business.
He has a reputation of being upright and proud, very attached to the aristocracy, and close to Louis XVI.
No, I can't remember...
I'm guessing he's a man of some importance. Spanish, I'd say. But just can't put a face to him.
Well, hope we meet to talk about it soon, Mother.
I don't know what you've gotten yourself into this time, but I'll bet you've got a lot to tell me.

I don't know what you've gotten yourself into this time, but I'll bet you've got a lot to tell me.
I thought my chimney was big but this one is beyond belief.
It's the least one can say! I've been longing for a warm fire for ages.
Since I set foot on the island I haven't ventured more than two yards away from it.
Have you also just arrived?
Oh, late morning, I'd say.
Louis! Come join us.
Monsieur, may I introduce you to Monseigneur, His Eminence cardinal Piaggi. He joins us straight from Rome.
Oh, just call me "Your Eminence", it's simpler.
George Washington, President of the United States of America.
Delighted at last to make your acquaintance, Mr. President.
Pleased to meet you, Mr President. Louis Mauras De Richet.
It is an honor to meet you.
Young man, let's keep it simple, please. Let us forget our fancy titles.
Nice to meet you, Louis.
I should imagine you never thought you'd be in such company?
I must admit that... I didn't. It's the first time that I've ever met so many illustrious personalities.
And you haven't seen anything yet. Generally, when Lord Mortimer organizes one of his receptions, there are over a dozen people here.
They can't all be here yet. And you'll see, most of the time, there's only the upper crust.
And I noticed you were already getting to know his Eminence at the entrance. It's the perfect place to build up a network.
What were you talking about, if you'll forgive my indiscretion?
My mother.
At the risk of disappointing you, we weren't conspiring over in our corner, sir.
His Eminence was simply telling me that he knew my mother and how much he held her in high esteem.
It so happens that Monsieur De Richet's mother is to join us.
About a letter
Oh, nothing special. His Eminence had an envelope to give to my mother, initially.
As he couldn't find her, he thought he'd give it to me.
Because your mother was supposed to join us?
That's right. She arrived a few weeks ago.
Several weeks at Lord Mortimer's? Hmm, she must be a special guest.
About the surprising main door
Believe me, she's not that special
His Eminence was asking me for my opinion about the style of the main door.
I have to admit, this place certainly doesn't lack panache!
It's simply stupefying.
Let's avoid the subject
No conspiracies on the horizon here, sir.
His Eminence was wondering how the devil our dear Mortimer got supplies in.
No, I simply did not deem the subject worthy enough to expose it before everyone.
Ah, pity, no scrumptious gossip or juicy tidbits? Unmentionable secrets or even money matters?
But you'll see, it will come. Despite all the good will in the world, you can't stop people scheming left and right around here.
Oh! Speak for yourself, sir.
Well, my friends, do any of you know the reason why we're here this time?
Not in the slightest. As for me, I've been invited by Sir Holm, a close friend of Lord Mortimer. But I do not know the reason why.
You see, Louis, every time Lord Mortimer organizes a reception, he always finds a moment to set up a chat with all the guests.
... During which time we remake the world!
Accompanied by gallons of absinthe and cussing. I'll leave you to imagine the result.
So if I understand rightly, Mr De Richet, you've come out here to join your mother. For what reason exactly?
She's gone missing
Lord Mortimer asked me to come as quickly as possible to find my mother who seems to have disappeared during her stay here.
Ah...
I took the first boat, and here I am.
I am so sorry.
Don't be, sir, it's not your fault.
Invent something
Like you, Mr President. I'm here as a result of Lord Mortimer's invitation.
Two members of the same family here? That is rare.
You know what they say, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your family! Hahaha
Seriously, though.
I know your mother well. Stay behind with me afterwards and we'll take a moment to speak about her.
Analyze the emblem.
Good Lord, Washington is wearing the emblem of the Grand Master of the Golden Order!
It's the highest distinction of the Order in the United States. It puts him on par with my mother.
He must really know his stuff when it comes to the occult.
Good evening, my friends!
Holy shit! That's the man from my vision!
An urgent case has delayed our host, Lord Mortimer.
He can't be present this evening and he sends his deepest apologies.
He's asked me here and he hasn't even turned up! Great start!
Ask that man?
Do you know that man?
Sir Gregory Holm, an English aristocrat, very influential. He's also close to Lord Mortimer, so don't be surprised if he acts like he's at home.
Say nothing
And now my dear guests, a light meal is served in the small salon.
For those who would like to, you are invited to follow me into the next room.
My dear fellow, you must have read my thoughts, I shall follow.
We'll have to be careful not to make too much noise, one of Lord Mortimer's guests is relaxing.
Oh, we shall be quiet.
Don't take it the wrong way, Sir Holm, but I've already eaten. Thus I shall be happy to remain by the fireside.
If you don't mind, Gregory, I should like to keep Mr. Washington company.
Please, feel at home.
And you, sir?
If I stay with Washington, we'll be able to speak about my mother.
But on the other hand, I'd like to learn more about this Holm. I saw him in my vision!
Stay and listen to Washington
Let's see what Washington has to say.
Sir, if you don't mind, I shall stay here.
Do exactly as you please, young man.
Discover what Holm knows about my mother
My vision is more important, let's follow Holm.
I'll follow you, sir.
Mr Washington, I hope to speak with you at greater length on another occasion.
Emily, please excuse me but I would like to speak to Sir Holm. I shall see you later.
I thought my chimney was big but this one is beyond belief.

Chains...
This is the last place in the world I'd expect to find prison chains.
Chains...
This is the last place in the world I'd expect to find prison chains.
There's no way I'm leaving without finding out more about Mother.
There's no way I'm leaving without finding out more about Mother.
(we see Wash and the servant walk toward Mauras' room, disappear behind the wall of the corridor)
(unintelligible conversation) â€“ reprise dialogue
Washington speaks, then listens. And he speaks again (looped)
(unintelligible conversation) â€“ reprise dialogue
It's high time I got some sleep.
Right... so what shall I do with this letter? It might be about my mother's disappearance.
But if I open it... I'll be betraying Piaggi's trust. What should I do?
Unseal the letter
OK, let's see what it contains. Too bad for Piaggi.
So.. it really is a list of French countrymen, Piaggi wasn't lying.
But now it's opened. Better get it to Mother soon.
Leave the letter closed
Damn, can't wait to open it, but I gave my word to Piaggi, so...
Too bad, I'll wait until I hand it to Mother.
Open the letter without breaking the seal
It's high time I got some sleep.

Wow... nice room! Mortimer sure doesn't do things halfway!
Wow... nice room! Mortimer sure doesn't do things halfway!
Stop! You're not getting anywhere with this, Von Borchert!
You know, I kind of get the same feeling, my dear Sarah? Listen...
Nothing... not a sound, no one's coming to save you.
That's what you think! The Golden Order knows exactly where we are!
Hahaha, By the time your ridiculous secret society turns up, I'll be long gone!
As for you, nothing will remain of your body.
If you touch a single hair on my mother's head, I'll skin you alive!
How touching.
You know, Louis, I have no intention of beating your dear mother. There are more persuasive ways of making you talk.
You've stolen something from me that I intend to get back.
Where have you hidden it?
Hahaha... Have you thought about look(ing in your butt)
No, Louis! Enough!
Von Borchert! You can't sell that book on the black market anymore! This is finished!
We know you're planning on selling it at one of Lord Mortimer's parties, all right. Just tell us who the buyer is and we can make a deal!
You've no idea of the trouble you've gotten yourselves into!
But you will tell me where it's hidden! I can promise you that.
I'm sure we will, but would you mind stepping back a bit? You...
Your breath bothers me.
Stop annoying our host, Louis!
Son, didn't what happened to you in Rome teach you anything?
Just a few more minutes and my concoction will be ready.
With this, your bodies will dissolve in less than four hours. You'll see, it loosens tongues in no time.
You know, I have to admit, Mother, the only thing you've ever taught me is that... damn motto of yours:
ALWAYS REMAIN RATIONAL... and open!
I got it, I've opened our shackles.
Draw him over here, I'll take care of him.
Von Borchert! Von Borchert, listen! Let's make a deal! I'll tell you where the book is if you let my mother go free.
Oh, what are you playing at!
Don't worry, mother.
You want to play the hero.
Pity you're not in any position to do so!
For the last time...
Where...
... is …
... Al Azif?
In a safe place,
Let me do this! Trust me!
ACT
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!
For God's sake, Louis! I told you to let me do it.
Let me see.
You know, I was in control of the situation, Mother.
Tell that to your nose. It's because of this kind of reaction that I prefer to work alone.
You ought to learn to trust me, Mother. Can't you be happy for once? I finally... WE... finally cracked the Von Borchert case.
He was just a middle man. He would have been more useful alive!
How many times must I tell you! You must never put your life on the line for me!
You're much more important than you can ever imagine.
Right, let's go now.
TRUST HER
Please, be my guest Mother!
Well done, Louis. You reacted perfectly.
How do you feel, mother?
Couldn't be better. He's alive. So I can question him after we get back.
Pity he's just a middle man. Means I haven't finished with this case.
Oh... I had a feeling you'd be running off on one of your adventures again, Mother!
You know what, I'm warning you, this time I'm coming with you!
No. Even though you impress me more and more, I have to do this on my own.
Mother, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Come on, let's go home.
Yeah yeah mama...
Coming, mother.
And don' t forget to send our men to tend to Von Borchert.
Way ahead of you.
Stop! You're not getting anywhere with this, Von Borchert!
You know, I kind of get the same feeling, my dear Sarah? Listen...
Nothing... not a sound, no one's coming to save you.

With this, your bodies will dissolve in less than four hours. You'll see, it loosens tongues in no time.
You know, I have to admit, Mother, the only thing you've ever taught me is that... damn motto of yours:
ALWAYS REMAIN RATIONAL... and open!
I got it, I've opened our shackles.
Draw him over here, I'll take care of him.
Von Borchert! Von Borchert, listen! Let's make a deal! I'll tell you where the book is if you let my mother go free.
Oh, what are you playing at!
Don't worry, mother.
You want to play the hero.
Pity you're not in any position to do so!
For the last time...
Where...
... is …
... Al Azif?
In a safe place,
Let me do this! Trust me!
ACT
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!
For God's sake, Louis! I told you to let me do it.
Let me see.
You know, I was in control of the situation, Mother.
Tell that to your nose. It's because of this kind of reaction that I prefer to work alone.
You ought to learn to trust me, Mother. Can't you be happy for once? I finally... WE... finally cracked the Von Borchert case.
He was just a middle man. He would have been more useful alive!
How many times must I tell you! You must never put your life on the line for me!
You're much more important than you can ever imagine.
Right, let's go now.
TRUST HER
Please, be my guest Mother!
Well done, Louis. You reacted perfectly.
How do you feel, mother?
Couldn't be better. He's alive. So I can question him after we get back.
Pity he's just a middle man. Means I haven't finished with this case.
Oh... I had a feeling you'd be running off on one of your adventures again, Mother!
You know what, I'm warning you, this time I'm coming with you!
No. Even though you impress me more and more, I have to do this on my own.
Mother, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Come on, let's go home.
Yeah yeah mama...
Coming, mother.
And don' t forget to send our men to tend to Von Borchert.
Way ahead of you.
Whaooh... Impressive.
Ah! My son, I was looking for you.
What can I do for you, Your Eminence?
I wanted to ask you, you are the son of Sarah De Richet, aren't you?
You see, your mother and I were supposed to meet here on this very spot, I was supposed to hand her a very important envelope, but I haven't seen her.
If only Mother had told me why she was coming here...
Anyway, I ought to take the envelope, it might have something to do with her disappearance.
Listen, If it will help, you can always give it to me.
Thank you, my son, I'll bear that in mind.
I'd rather deal with her directly. Don't take it personally.
Would you happen to know if your mother has arrived yet?
YES, she's been here for several weeks now.
Certainly, Your Eminence, mother got here some time ago.
I was hoping to find her when I arrived, but given the hour, she must be asleep by now.
You're right.
I shall see her tomorrow then.
NEVER MIND, give me your letter!
Listen, trust me, sir, and give me the letter, I'll take care of everything.
I appreciate your devotion, my son, but no thank you. Being hasty very rarely solves anything.
By the way, Your Eminence, I wasn't aware you knew my mother.
If you only knew, my son. I hold your mother in the highest regard.
She has rendered great service to the Church and her help is invaluable.
I hope you will follow in her footsteps.
If only she had told me where she was headed.
Nonetheless, our exchanges have always been discreet and I should like them to remain as such.
If your mother wishes to speak to you about us one day, I will not mind if she does so.
That is commendable.
But as we work together on a daily basis, it is surely just an oversight.
Most certainly.
You said you worked together. What do you do exactly?
We are members of the Golden Order
My mother and I belong to the same secret organization, The Golden Order, which I joined a few years ago.
Mother trained me and I assist in her research.
In other words, you can trust me.
Er, my child, you are telling a perfect stranger that you and your mother work for a secret society.
It would seem that discretion is not one of your specialities, my son.
You will understand that it does not encourage me to put my trust in you.
Oh shit...
Professional secret, sorry.
If you know my mother, you will understand that I cannot answer you, Your Eminence.
I'm sorry but...
Do not worry, my son. I perfectly understand and I expected nothing less from you.
Discretion and secrecy are both pillars of the organizations for which we work.
You are the worthy son of Sarah.
Art Collector
Mother passed her passion for art to me... ancient art. Very ancient.
Ah, I didn't know your mother was an art lover.
Mainly pre-christian objects which are believed to have unique properties.
Well, how interesting.
Now that you mention it, I can indeed imagine Sarah getting interested in that.
Our business is confidential
Be it Mother or myself, our motto has always been: 'discretion in all things'.
And to promise to never betray a word of honor.
Was your secret safe with Mother? It will be even more so with me.
You have convinced me.
The mystery with which your mother manages her business proves that she carries your motto close to her heart.
Your words seem sincere, my son.
All the same, it bothers me to see you in a quandary, Your Eminence. Is there any other solution?
Look, if it's of any help, you can always leave your envelope with me and I'll give it to her as soon as I see her.
Ah!... I hesitate.
Up till now, we have always dealt with her in person, and that has always been successful.
Do you think I should give it to you?
It depends on what it contains.
Only you know that, Your Eminence.
If you're asking me if you can trust me, or if I can keep a secret, the answer is yes, absolutely.
I understand.
In truth, it all depends on the nature of the contents of your letter.
It is a list of names.
This list must be of extreme importance.
Ah, If only you knew. It's a list of people that your mother must help.
Pretend I don't want it
Look, you seem hesitant. The simplest thing to do is just to give it to her when you see her.
After all, it's not that urgent.
Yes... I mean, yes, it is urgent. I mean what if we don't find each other here on the island.
Though I don't know yet when I'll be leaving. I might not be staying for very long.
Hmm, what to do?
Can you see a solution?
Come on, just give me the letter, for crying out loud!
I cannot run the risk alone. I am going to trust you. You seem like an honest man.
Bingo!
Yes, I'll give it to her if I find her.
Listen, you have nothing to fear.
I will give your letter to my mother the moment I find her.
The moment you find her?
You mean Sarah has gone missing?
Shit, I shouldn't have said that.
Let's not exaggerate, Your Eminence. I have no other information at this time, it's probably nothing.
You can count on me!
Don't worry, Your Eminence. Your secret is safe with me.
You know my mother's reputation. As her son, I will defend the De Richets' word with the same fervor.
Ah, I would expect nothing less.
Listen to me my child, if I give you the letter, can you promise me before God that no one other than your mother will read it?
Ok, no worries.
I swear by the Almighty God to honor the promise that no one but my mother shall cast her gaze upon your letter.
Good...
No thank you, no...
So it's... not through a lack of good will, but I'd rather swear by something else.
Er... I beg your pardon?
I mean, to be honest with you, and for my promise to keep all its value, I assure you it would be better if I didn't swear before God.
I shall swear upon my mother's life, if you prefer.
Are you aware of the enormity of what you just said to me, young man?
Pro-mise!
Your Eminence, if there is one thing you can count on, it is the value of a promise made by a De Richet.
Respecting our commitments has always been the pillar of our family. And nothing nor nobody will prevent that from happening.
Since you know my mother, you should know that a De Richet always keeps their word. You can be sure of that!
Thank you, my son, it is most reassuring.
Pff, you're welcome, especially as I've promised you nothing, my friend.
I don't believe in his God
Your Eminence, that is just not possible for me.
Wh … wh... why is that?
I have always had a Cartesian mind and I won't make false promises, I respect you too much for that.
I spend my time trying to find logical and reasonable answers to problems which, at first glance, may seem supernatural.
I'm not saying I don't believe in God as a concept. I just don't believe in the God of your sacred texts.
And I don't want to lie to you.
Even though your answer does... shock me, my son, I shall only hear your honesty.
All right, let's promise before God
Swear upon my mother's life
Listen, let's stop there, I am going to tell you a secret, Monsieur De Richet.
Your mother and I are organizing the escape of a fair number of French priests who face a massacre organized by the cursed Republican tribunals.
The Church is literally being bled like a beast.
Without your mother, hundreds of men of the cloth would have gone to the guillotine.
She has made the services of your order available to us by organizing the priests' safe passage across the borders.
Even if she does not share all our convictions, she always provided assistance. Young man, you can be proud to be her son!
Be it only for her sake, always respect your name.
Here, the letter I spoke of. It includes a list of about fifteen names ready for departure. Be quick.
Remember to tell Sarah when you see her that time is short.
Well played! I'll decide later, when I'm alone, whether to look at what it contains.
Er, listen, er, it is nothing against you but I prefer to keep this envelope. I'll wait until I run into your mother, it isn't as urgent as that, really.
So ! let's join the others.
Oh, man... if I had answered differently, I'm sure I could've gotten my hands on that letter. Too bad.
Whaooh... Impressive.
Ah! My son, I was looking for you.
What can I do for you, Your Eminence?
I wanted to ask you, you are the son of Sarah De Richet, aren't you?
You see, your mother and I were supposed to meet here on this very spot, I was supposed to hand her a very important envelope, but I haven't seen her.

So ! let's join the others.
Oh, man... if I had answered differently, I'm sure I could've gotten my hands on that letter. Too bad.
Good evening, Sir. May I ask your name, please?
Louis Mauras De Richet.
Mr. de Richet. Delighted to welcome you among us, sir.
You must be Sarah de Richet's son. I must tell you we are doing our utmost to find your mother as quickly as possible.
Where is Lord Mortimer?
I have an appointment with Lord Mortimer. Would you be so kind as to lead me to him?
Unfortunately Sir I cannot. I don't know exactly where my master is.
But rest assured, sir, everyone is waiting for you at the manor.
Sir Holm insists on welcoming you in person. Since your mother went missing, everyone has been concerned about finding her.
Who is Sir Holm?
A close friend of Lord Mortimer's.
Please, rest assured sir, it won't take us long to find your revered mother.
Indeed, we are searching the quays again because lights were seen at the wharf just last night.
What do you know about my mother?
What can you tell me about the disappearance of my mother?
Two weeks have passed since sir's mother went missing. All the staff here have since been busy searching every nook and cranny of the island.
But sir may rest assured, we shouldn't be long in finding her.
And just what have you found so far?
It would seem that sir's mother may be hiding on the island and regularly changing her location.
But no one seems to know why she would find this behaviour necessary.
What do you mean?
On several occasions, we have found leftovers of food, a few of her things, or even traces of campsites.
The reason why we are searching the wharf again is because lights were spotted there last night.
Where we are now?
Indeed, sir. According to our information, lights were seen in the middle of the night, sir.
After verification, none of the guests seem to have left the manor last night.
We think that perhaps sir's mother was here.
Are there any witnesses?
Did anyone see anything else?
Unfortunately not, sir. Only lights were seen by servants of the manor, sir.
And as I was saying, sir, all the guests were asleep and no one seems to have noticed anything at all.
Have you found anything here?
And? Did you find anything then?
We discovered a certain amount of damage, sir, on the wooden part of the wharf.
What type of damage?
Broken barrels mainly. We'll do whatever is necessary to have them rapidly repaired.
But quite frankly, I can't imagine what sir's mother would have been doing with them.
What could Mother have been doing with barrels?
Nevertheless our search of the wharf hasn't been entirely unsuccessful, though.
What do you mean?
We seem to have found an object that would appear to belong to sir's mother. A handkerchief.
The handkerchief is embroidered with the initials S. d R.
We came to the conclusion that they are the initials of sir's mother, Sarah de Richet.
I have orders to give it to Lord Mortimer as soon as I see him.
I know my mother. She's not the kind to go for a midnight stroll on the wharf for nothing.
I've got to find out what the hell she was doing here!
Where exactly did you find the handkerchief?
On the landing dock Sir, the one you arrived by.
Let me have the handkerchief, I'll take care of it.
Give me the handkerchief, I'll personally show it to Lord Mortimer.
Well, I...
I've have traveled hard for several days in order to get here...
Yes, but...
... invited by your master …
No, of course, but...
... because my mother went missing right under your nose.
Sir, please, I...
And having only just arrived, you refuse to give me her personal belongings?
Of course not, sir. It was never my intention to contradict sir. Here you are.
I must return now. There is still much to prepare in order to welcome all the guests.
You'll give me back the handkerchief.
That handkerchief belongs to me. Please, hand it over now.
But sir, I...
I'll speak directly to your master about it. It will be a very long conversation.
Uh, of..of course, sir. Please take it.
On that note, I must leave you, sir. There is still much to prepare in order to welcome all the guests.
You will kindly give me the handkerchief
Pass me the handkerchief.
But... but sir, my orders were to give it to my master.
Are you refusing to give me my own mother's personal belongings?
Even though she was greatly looking forward to meeting your master, she's gone missing. And you seem incapable of finding her.
Oh, but sir, please...
And to top it all off, you refuse to give me the handkerchief that she so often let me use.
Do I deserve such little consideration in your eyes?
Is that what you wish me to report to your master?
No, certainly not, sir! Please forgive me, sir, I have been such an idiot! Here you are!
Let us say no more, then...
Thank you. Thank you very much for your cooperation.
When sir would like to go to the manor, it will suffice to take the stone stairs there.
Duty calls. Of course sir may take as much time as he requires.
It is indeed your handkerchief, Mother.
You must have come here for a specific reason. I need to know what it is.
Good evening, Sir. May I ask your name, please?
Louis Mauras De Richet.
Mr. de Richet. Delighted to welcome you among us, sir.

Let's think... what could she have been doing out here on this wharf?
Let's think... what could she have been doing out here on this wharf?
This old iron gate is locked.
Open the gate
It's locked. I'll never get it open bare-handed.
Use an iron bar
Clearly, I'm not much for manual labour. Let's see if I can get it open another way.
Force it open with the bar
Pick the lock
There we are.
Use the iron key

A broken floorboard.
A wooden floorboard.
Examine
Probably comes from this part of the wharf. The wood is slightly eaten away of course, but it still would have been fine if it weren't smashed.
Question where it came from
Judging by the splinters of the wood, this floorboard has been ripped up. Yet it was in decent condition.
I wonder why someone ripped it up?
What's the point of doing this?

I really must find you, dear Mother. And quickly, too.

Latin, easy to translate

Mother? Oh shit, your hand!
So?
Okay, it's done!
Did you put it in a safe place?
Yes, I made sure no one was following me. Don't worry, Sarah, no one's going to find it.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yes, I'm sure!
Right. Just one thing left to do.
What?
Have you lost your mind?
No, Mother, no, don't! Don't!
There's no other way.
If you... if you kill me, you won't find it!
That is the point, my dear. No one must ever put their hands on it again.
No! But I trusted you!
No, Sarah, don't. No. Nooo!

I absolutely need to find you, Mother.

Aaaah
Are you alright?
This looks like a pistol case. But it's empty.
I don't know if this has anything to do with you, Mother, but if it does... at least now you're armed …  
... just like in my vision. And none of it is telling me anything useful.
