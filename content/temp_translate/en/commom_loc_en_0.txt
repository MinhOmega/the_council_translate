These are magnesium crystals.

Judging from what's left, it looks like a medical file.
Too bad. Pretty much unreadable now.

I know you are trying to find out what happened to Elizabeth...
But it's getting out of hand now... Your escapade on the continent cost me enough as it is!
I know it hasn't been easy for you leaving Elizabeth confined in her room for a month so she doesn't bump into Sarah
But to run away? Without warning! I had to lie to cover you, Johann...
Act as if you arrived separately, only a few days ago and persuade William to do the same with his guests.
I demand that you come to your senses and take hold of yourself.
I asked you to fetch something so we can get it off the island, not for to study it in a vain hope of acquiring power.
It won't give you any answers, let me be clear on that.
At most we run the risk of losing it again.
So, for the last time, please go and leave it at the agreed place.
I can confirm that someone will pick it up immediately.

I should find something to help reveal the traces of ink on the blotter...
What might do the trick?
I have to find some ammonium sulfide if I want to make the text appear by capillary action.
Perfect! Here's some...
Think, damn it!
Think, Louis...
I know for sure that lime water neutralizes chemical actions but doesn't work on ink.
I must find something else.
Ammonium sulfide

What can I do for you, sir?
I am at your service, day and night, sir.
What can you tell me about our host?
I would like you to speak about your master, Lord Mortimer.
Do please excuse me, sir, but I shall make no comment about my master.
Is there anything else that sir would like to know?
What can you tell me about the guests?
What can you tell me about the guests?
Do excuse me, sir, but I am bound by discretion to say nothing about Lord Mortimer's guests, sir.
Perhaps sir would like to know something else?
I have a few questions about the manor.
What can I find on the ground floor?
Yes. Can you briefly describe the ground floor, please?
Very well, sir.
On the ground floor, there are mainly living rooms.
Sir finds himself at present in the Grand Hall.
From the Grand Hall, sir can access, on one side, the Small Salon where the guests like to relax with a good book.
From there, sir can access the Conference Room, which is closed at present for preparations.
That is where Lord Mortimer likes to gather all of his guests for talks.
From the other side of the Grand Hall, sir may access the Dining Room.
That is where sir's meals will be served.
From the Dining Room, sir may benefit from an exceptional view overlooking the island.
It is also the best way to access the Portrait Gallery, where a large part of Lord Mortimer's works are exhibited.
And in the gallery, sir will also find access to the Garden.
But sir may be reassured, the building is accessible on both sides, so that it surrounds the Garden in question.
So, sir should not find cause to worry, no one has ever gotten lost.
Except for my mother...
Has Sir another question?
What's on the first floor?
What's on the first floor?
The first floor is reserved for guests, sir. That is where sir will find his private rooms.
The main corridor leads around the building. Three stairways will enable sir to return to the ground floor.
It is also from there that sir will be able to reach the second floor.
Thank you very much.
Anything else, sir?
What is on the second floor?
Yes. What can I find on the second floor?
That floor is strictly reserved for Lord Mortimer, sir.
In the west wing on the second floor are his private chambers.
In the east wing are the rooms reserved for Lord Mortimer's personal guests.
At the moment, these rooms are reserved for Sir Holm, sir.
But only authorized guests may access that area.
Does sir have any more questions?
May I walk outside?
What is outside on the island exactly?
Lord Mortimer has made a point of keeping the main part of the island in its natural state, sir. For security reasons, only the wharves and the gardens are accessible to guests.
If sir would like to walk along the wharves, he has only to follow the pathway used upon his arrival.
If he would like to walk in the interior gardens of the manor, I would advise sir to pass through the Portrait Gallery.
May I help sir in any other way?
Return
I was wondering if you could help me out.
As I was unable to bring my personal effects with me, I was wondering if you could find me a few items?
Of course, sir. What would you require?
Would you have any Golden Elixir?
You wouldn't have a little Golden Elixir I could use, would you?
Oh, unfortunately, sir, I have orders not to give any of that medicine to any of Lord Mortimer's guests.
Some guests are here to follow a very strict treatment. Mixing or combining certain substances would be dangerous for sir.
No panic, I know what it is.
My good fellow, you're right. One should never mix treatments without the advice of an expert.
It so happens that I usually make my own Golden Elixir, but I haven't brought my kit with me.
Perhaps, in that case, would you fetch a spoonful of ethyl alcohol, ethereal oil, and ten millilitres of ethanol for me?
Along with that, a small quantity of gold, please. Just a few crumbs will suffice.
Ah, I see that sir knows his subject. Therefore I see no reason why I shouldn't give them to you.
I hope that will be enough for you sir, because I haven't any more.
Thank you, that will be fine.
May I help with anything else, sir?
It is not for consumption.
That's fine, I have no intention of swallowing this remedy.
You see, I generally use it to put the shine back on my shoes.
But maybe you'd rather I ask permission from Lord Mortimer?
Where is he? I'd like to tell him about my shoe problem.
Sir need do nothing of the sort. There is no reason to disturb Lord Mortimer with this small matter.
As you wish.
Here you are, sir. I hope sir will have enough with one bottle as I haven't any more.
Oh I'll make do. It's good of you to get this much.
May I do anything else for sir?
Return
Would you have any Devil's Thorn? Maltese Cross ?
Ah! I still haven't quite recovered after that boat crossing. Would you happen to have any Devil's Thorn, by any chance?
I...  I am sorry, sir, but the Devil's Thorn may be just a plant, but it is also a powerful psychotropic drug that causes undesirable diuretic effects.
I would advise against sir taking any.
I'll take full responsibility; give some to me.
Don't worry, my good man, I know the effects of Devil's Thorn very well.
I've been taking it for years without any adverse effects. I've never had cause to complain, you can believe me.
That is well, sir. Here is sir's herb.
What else can I do for you, sir?
You just have to know how to take it.
You see, tribulus cistoides is from the zygophyllaceae family, very rich in nitrates and potassium chloride.
It was used in India seven hundred years before Christ, my good fellow. And I know nothing better to perk you up.
Oh! As sir wishes. Here is the herb, sir.
May I help you in anything else, sir?
Return
Would you have any Carmelite Water?
A little Carmelite Water would do me a lot of good, could you find me some, please?
Oh, the tonics are under lock and key, sir. Lord Mortimer only allows access to them in cases of emergency.
That's scandalous
What? That's the last straw!
Lord Mortimer himself asked me to take the sea to join him here. I accepted that out of kindness.
The voyage was undertaken in conditions that I prefer not to speak about.
And then, at long last I arrive and...  and you refuse me a simple flask of Carmelite Water?
No, sir...  I...  I...
Your name! Tell me your name!
Er, er, here, sir, your Carmelite Water. Please accept my sincerest apologies.
If sir requires anything else whatsoever, sir has only to ask.
Very well, it is a matter of urgency.
Listen, I suffer from terrible migraines and the voyage by boat has brought on my rheumatism.
So, unless you have anything else to alleviate the pain, please give me some quickly. Thank you.
Oh and...  and the one from Bordeaux, right? I prefer it to the one from Paris.
Immediately, sir. Here. I hope sir will get well again quickly.
Anything else, sir?
Return
Have you got any Amber?
My good fellow, would you have any amber available?
I would, but unfortunately I don't think I am authorized to give it out, sir. I believe it is a precious stone.
Come now, it has no value...
Look, you aren't going to kick up a fuss about a vulgar piece of resin, are you?
Don't believe what they say about amber. It does nothing to warm up infants' bodies, let alone prevent toothache.
And neither does this fossil oleo-resin stimulate fertility, you can believe me.
Thank you for educating me, I didn't know. Here you are, sir.
Does sir desire anything else?
I'll play a trick on him and steal from him...
No point in lying, you know. I know full well you haven't got any.
I would never think of lying, sir, I don't believe I am authorized to give it away, that is all.
Amber, here? I'd be surprised...
Yet, I assure you, sir.
No, you're pulling my leg. I don't believe you.
I wouldn't dare to joke with sir.
Yeah, sure, you're just leading me on. I dare you to show it to me, if you really have some.
Well, then, sir, here is a piece.
Oh...  right. Well, I'm impressed. Can you lend it to me for a minute?
Of course, sir, here.
Wow, I can hardly believe it.
Well, I have other questions.
Of course, sir. But, sir, I believe you haven't given me back the amber, sir.
What? What amber?
The piece I gave to sir.
No, I don't know what you're talking about. You really ought to look after your things. It can't be easy to come across amber in these parts.
Ah...  errm...  well...  does sir desire anything else?
Return
Manuscript
What's that book you're hiding in your jacket?
The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe, sir. And I am not hiding it.
Hand it to me, please.
It is damaged, sir. I would never dare lend sir a book in such a pitiful state, sir. I took it to restore.
I'll take care of it.
Indeed, this masterpiece must not become more damaged.
Let me have it and I'll take care of it personally. I love antiquarian books.
It bothers me somewhat, it isn't sir's job to take care of it, really.
No, but I would love to. You'd be doing me a favor by letting me have it.
In that case, sir, I shall leave it in your care with pleasure.
May I do anything else for sir?
I'll make him believe that it's MY book!
Hang on...  but...  it's mine.
Beg pardon, sir?
It's my book! I'm telling you, it's my book!
With all due respect, sir, I hope sir will understand that I have doubts. You see, I found it in Lord Mortimer's library.
Huh, there you are then! That's exactly where I left it!
I am...  quite put out, sir, I...  don't know what to say.
In that case I suggest you say nothing and hand it over.
But...  I...
Now.
But Sir, I... Very well, sir. Here you are. May sir take good care of it, it is damaged.
And you've damaged it as well? Oh, bravo, bravo!
No, no, I didn't do anything, it wasn't me, sir.
Say pardon.
Pardon me, Sir.
Very good. There were some other things I wanted to go over with you.
Return
Return
Take your leave
What can I do for you, sir?
I am at your service, day and night, sir.
What can you tell me about our host?
I would like you to speak about your master, Lord Mortimer.
Do please excuse me, sir, but I shall make no comment about my master.
Is there anything else that sir would like to know?
What can you tell me about the guests?
What can you tell me about the guests?
Do excuse me, sir, but I am bound by discretion to say nothing about Lord Mortimer's guests, sir.
Perhaps sir would like to know something else?
I have a few questions about the manor.
What can I find on the ground floor?
Yes. Can you briefly describe the ground floor, please?
Very well, sir.
On the ground floor, there are mainly living rooms.
Sir finds himself at present in the Grand Hall.
From the Grand Hall, sir can access, on one side, the Small Salon where the guests like to relax with a good book.
From there, sir can access the Conference Room, which is closed at present for preparations.
That is where Lord Mortimer likes to gather all of his guests for talks.
From the other side of the Grand Hall, sir may access the Dining Room.
That is where sir's meals will be served.
From the Dining Room, sir may benefit from an exceptional view overlooking the island.
It is also the best way to access the Portrait Gallery, where a large part of Lord Mortimer's works are exhibited.
And in the gallery, sir will also find access to the Garden.
But sir may be reassured, the building is accessible on both sides, so that it surrounds the Garden in question.
So, sir should not find cause to worry, no one has ever gotten lost.
Except for my mother...
Has Sir another question?
What's on the first floor?
What's on the first floor?
The first floor is reserved for guests, sir. That is where sir will find his private rooms.
The main corridor leads around the building. Three stairways will enable sir to return to the ground floor.

Those are the maps that Lord Mortimer had on the wall in his room!
Those are the maps that Lord Mortimer had on the wall in his room!
Elizabeth Adams is the daughter of John Adams, vice president of the United States.</n></n>Elizabeth was rejected by her parents at birth and was declared still-born. Brought up in isolation, she grew into a frail young woman with bipolar disorder, devoured by her terrible fits of anxiety. Her deepest secrets were slowly gnawing away at her from inside.</n>Despite numerous treatments, nothing could cure her, the young woman continued to descend into folly.</n></n>As a friend of Sir Gregory Holm and of Lord Mortimer, John Adams decided to send his daughter to Lord Mortimer's manor in the hope that he could help her.</n></n>With little hope, Elizabeth has now been at the manor for a short while.
Sarah Faustine de Richet is a rich French aristocrat.</n></n>Thirty-four years ago, Sarah took over one of the most important secret societies: the Golden Order.</n>A woman of strong will, Sarah endeavored to infiltrate the highest circles of society. Politics, trade transactions, Secrets of State or paranormal spheres, the Order had an eye over everything.</n>One of the biggest areas of growth that Sarah brought to the Order was the development of its branches in America, Europe and Central Africa.</n>Not to mention the expansion of her occult section, which she took care of personally.</n></n>Since he was just a boy, Sarah has been preparing her son, Louis, to become the new face of the Golden Order.
Emma Hillsborrow is the twin sister of Emily Hillsborrow.</n></n>Living in the shadow of her sister, Emma shares the same identity with her in the eyes of the world. The two sisters linked their destiny in the most intimate way possible. Workplace, boyfriends, lovers, the two sisters shared everything together. This double identity was much appreciated by Charlotte de Mecklembourg-Strelitz, the present queen of England when she asked the two sisters to serve the crown.</n>But with time, Emma had increasingly greater difficulty with her role as a double.</n></n>It is thus tired of her role, that Emma travels to the Mortimer manor as diplomatic representative of England.
Manuel Godoy: Secretary of State and Head of the Spanish Government.</n></n>A favorite of King Charles IV of Spain, Godoy rapidly climbed the political ranks. Lover of Queen Marie Louise Bourbon of Parma, he attracted the envy of Spanish princes. As Secretary of State, he developed and strengthened the Spanish colonial empire, especially in the Americas. A close friend of Louis XVI, King of France, he worked hard for the king's liberation, but in vain. This served to fuel his resentment of the Republican government of France.</n></n>Invited by Sir Gregory Holm, Godoy arrived at Lord Mortimer's manor with the firm intention of calming the expansionist desires of the United States of America on their continent.
Emily Hillsborrow is an English Duchess, close to the English crown.</n></n>Very discreet about her origins, Emily only came onto the political scene after her wedding, that some qualified as a marriage of interest, to an old English aristocrat on the decline. Libertarian, modern, but discreet, she has taken it upon herself to establish close ties with her peers.</n>In a few years, she has become the favorite diplomat of the Queen, which is what probably prompted her prime minister, William Pitt, to take her as private secretary, thus provoking much suspicion and jealousy.</n></n>As a regular visitor, Emily accepted Sir Gregory Holm's invitation to come to Lord Mortimer's island because, for nothing in the world, would she miss one of these famed receptions.
Sir Gregory Holm, Baron of Nottingham, is a very influential British aristocrat.</n></n>Confirmed royalist, Sir Gregory Holm spent his career extending the influence of the United Kingdom throughout the world. From the flourishing East India Company to the Spanish trading posts in America, he stamped his hallmark on key decisions made by the world's pre-eminent economic power. In England, he contributed to the reduction of the national debt and, being very attached to family values, he invested time in the working class, creating charity schools in order to offer a decent education to the “future links in the next industrial revolution”.</n></n>A network-builder, Holm always finds pleasure in attending the social gatherings of his old friend, Lord Mortimer.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer, Marquis of Westfordshire and peer of Great Britain, is an extremely rich English aristocrat, as discreet as he is influential.</n></n>An investor of talent, Mortimer's success in business was masterful.</n>He finished by withdrawing from the public arena and isolating himself more and more often on his private island. A major patron of the arts, he finances a large number of artists in diverse fields and takes great pleasure in bringing together unexpected personalities. He does the same with the greats of this world, men of influence and men of state of the time.</n></n>He regularly organizes social gatherings on his private island, off the coast of England.
Napoleon Bonaparte is a young lieutenant in the French army.</n></n>In his early youth, Napoleon was uprooted from his native Corsica and thus he bore a grudge against the aristocracy, the clergy and the French people who failed to accept him. He joined the French army with the firm intention of making a name for himself and of marking history by proving his true worth.</n>Searching for backing of any kind, he attracted the sympathy and support of Lord Mortimer.</n></n>Invited to the latter's reception, Napoleon intends to prove his value to the world.
Jacques Peru is one of the fathers of the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris.</n></n>During the Terror, he quickly became one of the most worrying figures in all of Paris. He distinguished himself by taking part in the siege of the Bastille and in the capture of Louis XVI, the current King of France. He was involved in the creation of the “Revolutionary Tribunal”.</n>Is he a man of law or torturer? Nobody dares say. This judge of the people has overseen many trials that sent opponents and traitors of the Revolution to the guillotine.</n></n>Peru interrupts his revolutionary activities when Lord Mortimer, his patron, invites him to join the latter's social gatherings.
His Eminence the Cardinal Giuseppe Piaggi is a legate of Pope Pius VI.</n></n>A distinguished speaker, Giuseppe Piaggi worked throughout his career to serve the principles of the Roman Catholic church. A man of science and amateur philosopher, he quickly caught the ear of the Pope who discretely named him Cardinal “In Pectore”. He was thus able to use this relationship of trust to help Pius VI in his difficult mission of guiding the faithful.</n></n>Invited by Sir Gregory Holm, Piaggi is delighted to meet his old friend Mortimer in order to represent the interests of the Holy See.
Servants</n>All Mortimer's servants wear a mask. It is a recurring subject of conversation among the guests; no one knows the true reason.
George Washington is the founding father and first president of the United States of America.</n></n>Washington shared his life between military and political success. Very early on, he was introduced by Sarah de Richet into the upper circles of an influential secret society from France: the Golden Order. He later took the helm of the American branch. Tired of politics, he wanted to retire to his property in Virginia, but that was without taking into account Lord Mortimer, who encouraged him to come out of retirement. On the advice of his friend, he ran for a second term and was successful.</n></n>Invited by Mortimer to his island, Washington likes to attend such social gatherings incognito.
Johan Christoph von Wöllner is the Prussian Minister of Religion.</n></n>A friend of King Frederick William II of Prussia, von Wöllner secretly managed the affaires of State. Former pastor and member of a Masonic Lodge, he had all the time he needed to convert his King to his point of view. Together they opened their own lodge, under the influence of the Rosicrucians.</n>Passionate about the occult sciences and alchemy, he led a war of religion in his country and fiercely combated the ideas of the Enlightenment.</n></n>A friend of Sir Gregory Holm, von Wöllner believes in spiritual alchemy, of which the materia prima is the human soul.
The only son of Sarah, Louis Mauras de Richet is a young Parisian aristocrat.</n></n>Ever since he was a young child, Louis moved in his mother's circles, and so it was natural that on his fourteenth birthday he entered the Golden Order, the secret society headed by Sarah.</n>Precocious, Louis progressed quickly at her side, despite the daily treatment his mother proscribed for his chronic migraines. He climbed the ladder until he was able to assist his mother in occult cases, for which he was particularly talented. As time went by, he became shaped in the image that his mother had held for him.</n></n>Everything pointed to, one day, young Louis becoming the head of the Golden Order.

January 24th, 1793
January 23rd, 1793
Elizabeth Adams is the daughter of John Adams, vice president of the United States.</n></n>Elizabeth was rejected by her parents at birth and was declared still-born. Brought up in isolation, she grew into a frail young woman with bipolar disorder, devoured by her terrible fits of anxiety. Her deepest secrets were slowly gnawing away at her from inside.</n>Despite numerous treatments, nothing could cure her, the young woman continued to descend into folly.</n></n>As a friend of Sir Gregory Holm and of Lord Mortimer, John Adams decided to send his daughter to Lord Mortimer's manor in the hope that he could help her.</n></n>With little hope, Elizabeth has now been at the manor for a short while.
Sarah Faustine de Richet is a rich French aristocrat.</n></n>Thirty-four years ago, Sarah took over one of the most important secret societies: the Golden Order.</n>A woman of strong will, Sarah endeavored to infiltrate the highest circles of society. Politics, trade transactions, Secrets of State or paranormal spheres, the Order had an eye over everything.</n>One of the biggest areas of growth that Sarah brought to the Order was the development of its branches in America, Europe and Central Africa.</n>Not to mention the expansion of her occult section, which she took care of personally.</n></n>Since he was just a boy, Sarah has been preparing her son, Louis, to become the new face of the Golden Order.
Emma Hillsborrow is the twin sister of Emily Hillsborrow.</n></n>Living in the shadow of her sister, Emma shares the same identity with her in the eyes of the world. The two sisters linked their destiny in the most intimate way possible. Workplace, boyfriends, lovers, the two sisters shared everything together. This double identity was much appreciated by Charlotte de Mecklembourg-Strelitz, the present queen of England when she asked the two sisters to serve the crown.</n>But with time, Emma had increasingly greater difficulty with her role as a double.</n></n>It is thus tired of her role, that Emma travels to the Mortimer manor as diplomatic representative of England.
Manuel Godoy: Secretary of State and Head of the Spanish Government.</n></n>A favorite of King Charles IV of Spain, Godoy rapidly climbed the political ranks. Lover of Queen Marie Louise Bourbon of Parma, he attracted the envy of Spanish princes. As Secretary of State, he developed and strengthened the Spanish colonial empire, especially in the Americas. A close friend of Louis XVI, King of France, he worked hard for the king's liberation, but in vain. This served to fuel his resentment of the Republican government of France.</n></n>Invited by Sir Gregory Holm, Godoy arrived at Lord Mortimer's manor with the firm intention of calming the expansionist desires of the United States of America on their continent.
Emily Hillsborrow is an English Duchess, close to the English crown.</n></n>Very discreet about her origins, Emily only came onto the political scene after her wedding, that some qualified as a marriage of interest, to an old English aristocrat on the decline. Libertarian, modern, but discreet, she has taken it upon herself to establish close ties with her peers.</n>In a few years, she has become the favorite diplomat of the Queen, which is what probably prompted her prime minister, William Pitt, to take her as private secretary, thus provoking much suspicion and jealousy.</n></n>As a regular visitor, Emily accepted Sir Gregory Holm's invitation to come to Lord Mortimer's island because, for nothing in the world, would she miss one of these famed receptions.
Sir Gregory Holm, Baron of Nottingham, is a very influential British aristocrat.</n></n>Confirmed royalist, Sir Gregory Holm spent his career extending the influence of the United Kingdom throughout the world. From the flourishing East India Company to the Spanish trading posts in America, he stamped his hallmark on key decisions made by the world's pre-eminent economic power. In England, he contributed to the reduction of the national debt and, being very attached to family values, he invested time in the working class, creating charity schools in order to offer a decent education to the “future links in the next industrial revolution”.</n></n>A network-builder, Holm always finds pleasure in attending the social gatherings of his old friend, Lord Mortimer.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer, Marquis of Westfordshire and peer of Great Britain, is an extremely rich English aristocrat, as discreet as he is influential.</n></n>An investor of talent, Mortimer's success in business was masterful.</n>He finished by withdrawing from the public arena and isolating himself more and more often on his private island. A major patron of the arts, he finances a large number of artists in diverse fields and takes great pleasure in bringing together unexpected personalities. He does the same with the greats of this world, men of influence and men of state of the time.</n></n>He regularly organizes social gatherings on his private island, off the coast of England.
Napoleon Bonaparte is a young lieutenant in the French army.</n></n>In his early youth, Napoleon was uprooted from his native Corsica and thus he bore a grudge against the aristocracy, the clergy and the French people who failed to accept him. He joined the French army with the firm intention of making a name for himself and of marking history by proving his true worth.</n>Searching for backing of any kind, he attracted the sympathy and support of Lord Mortimer.</n></n>Invited to the latter's reception, Napoleon intends to prove his value to the world.
Jacques Peru is one of the fathers of the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris.</n></n>During the Terror, he quickly became one of the most worrying figures in all of Paris. He distinguished himself by taking part in the siege of the Bastille and in the capture of Louis XVI, the current King of France. He was involved in the creation of the “Revolutionary Tribunal”.</n>Is he a man of law or torturer? Nobody dares say. This judge of the people has overseen many trials that sent opponents and traitors of the Revolution to the guillotine.</n></n>Peru interrupts his revolutionary activities when Lord Mortimer, his patron, invites him to join the latter's social gatherings.
His Eminence the Cardinal Giuseppe Piaggi is a legate of Pope Pius VI.</n></n>A distinguished speaker, Giuseppe Piaggi worked throughout his career to serve the principles of the Roman Catholic church. A man of science and amateur philosopher, he quickly caught the ear of the Pope who discretely named him Cardinal “In Pectore”. He was thus able to use this relationship of trust to help Pius VI in his difficult mission of guiding the faithful.</n></n>Invited by Sir Gregory Holm, Piaggi is delighted to meet his old friend Mortimer in order to represent the interests of the Holy See.
Servants</n>All Mortimer's servants wear a mask. It is a recurring subject of conversation among the guests; no one knows the true reason.
George Washington is the founding father and first president of the United States of America.</n></n>Washington shared his life between military and political success. Very early on, he was introduced by Sarah de Richet into the upper circles of an influential secret society from France: the Golden Order. He later took the helm of the American branch. Tired of politics, he wanted to retire to his property in Virginia, but that was without taking into account Lord Mortimer, who encouraged him to come out of retirement. On the advice of his friend, he ran for a second term and was successful.</n></n>Invited by Mortimer to his island, Washington likes to attend such social gatherings incognito.
Johan Christoph von Wöllner is the Prussian Minister of Religion.</n></n>A friend of King Frederick William II of Prussia, von Wöllner secretly managed the affaires of State. Former pastor and member of a Masonic Lodge, he had all the time he needed to convert his King to his point of view. Together they opened their own lodge, under the influence of the Rosicrucians.</n>Passionate about the occult sciences and alchemy, he led a war of religion in his country and fiercely combated the ideas of the Enlightenment.</n></n>A friend of Sir Gregory Holm, von Wöllner believes in spiritual alchemy, of which the materia prima is the human soul.
The only son of Sarah, Louis Mauras de Richet is a young Parisian aristocrat.</n></n>Ever since he was a young child, Louis moved in his mother's circles, and so it was natural that on his fourteenth birthday he entered the Golden Order, the secret society headed by Sarah.</n>Precocious, Louis progressed quickly at her side, despite the daily treatment his mother proscribed for his chronic migraines. He climbed the ladder until he was able to assist his mother in occult cases, for which he was particularly talented. As time went by, he became shaped in the image that his mother had held for him.</n></n>Everything pointed to, one day, young Louis becoming the head of the Golden Order.

Gerard von Borchert is a merchant of Occult Art on the black market.</n></n>Von Borchert has been followed by the Golden Order over the past months, after having stolen a very ancient occult work from them. He aimed to hand it over to his paymaster during one of Lord Mortimer's private parties.</n>Sarah partly accepted the invitation from Lord Mortimer in order to follow this trail.

My dear Elizabeth,
I'm writing to inform you of some unfortunate news. We won't be able to meet as planned on the first Sunday of May.
I've been told that you're no better and unfortunately, your brothers and I are absolutely snowed under by the work required to govern this new country.
Please excuse us, as soon as we can get free, even if it's just for a day, I promise we shall come and see you.
Your loving father,
John Adams
P.S. Don't hold it against your mother; she still isn't ready. Please don't judge her; I'm sure you"ll be able to put all this behind you, one day.

My dear Elizabeth,
Your last letter gave me much cause for concern.
Your words were so cold, as if emotions no longer matter to you.
Father maintains that the secondary effects of your treatment still trouble you.
But that they will soon subside. Should I believe him?
I cling to the belief that we shall soon see each other again. At long last!
Write soon.
Your loving sister, Abigail.
P.S. Don't forget to tell me what present you want.

My dear sister,
The cancellation of our reunion hit me like a stab to the heart.
Father told me it was for your well-being, but I can't help but blame him.
He claims that your condition has worsened and that it could be dangerous for both of us if we met.
If only I knew where you were, believe me, I'd be at your side.
I haven't received any news from you in a long time. Please write.
Your loving sister, Abigail.
P.S. I hope you like the enclosed talisman.

August 24, 1792
Elizabeth,
I am driven to despair and doubt there is any point in writing to you.
I'm not even sure you receive my letters.
Father controls my correspondence more and more. I am certain he filters our exchanges.
Thankfully, one of the chambermaids is able to help me get my letters to you.
But they still remain unanswered.
I often think about you and pray everyday to be able to hold you tight.
We have so much time to make up. I beg you, answer me, please.
Your loving sister, Abigail.
P.S. That horrible woman came again yesterday. She spent a long time speaking with Father.
I didn't understand everything because they spoke in French, but I'm sure they were talking about you.

Dear E,
I received your last letter; unfortunately the Crown informed the Golden Order that our mission should under no circumstances hamper Sir Gregory's plans.
Decidedly, they have support from the highest level in Buckingham Palace.
So here we both are, hands and feet tied and little room to maneuver.
Keep me abreast of events; our mission is becoming more complicated.
Yours, E.
(P.S. The French chapter of the Order doesn't appear to know anything about the arrival of our friend Sarah. I therefore can not comment on it. However, my guess is that she has come here for personal reasons.)

Dear Gregory,
Thank you for the information. I've managed to find out about the names you gave me.
George Washington is a man you can trust.
In spite of his obvious talent for politics, he has remained upright and honest. On the other hand, as you may well know, he is already doing business with Lord Mortimer. It will be more difficult to approach him.
Napoleon Bonaparte was unknown to me until today. He's a passionate young French soldier for whom Mortimer predicts a promising future.
Take heed, he is a man of conviction, which, to my mind, makes him potentially dangerous.
As for Sarah de Richet, what more is there to say? You already know each other.
She was apparently invited by Lord Mortimer, about an on-going matter in Paris that concerns a receiver in stolen art.
See you soon.
Duchess Emily Hillsborrow

Madam,
I shall never thank you enough for all your care and attention.
I shall be indebted to you until my last breath. If you have any request of me, you only need ask.
With regards to my son, William, I shall never thank you enough for looking after him.
You know the latter's preferences and you will understand he needs you desperately.
For that and as agreed with Queen Charlotte, our friend Duke Hillsborrow will carry out his task and meet with you within six months. From then on you'll be free from want.
Yours sincerely,

Madame,
Thank you for consoling the Queen.
The King's situation is worsening, but I wager he'll recover from this present fit.
Next time you speak with her Majesty the Queen, would you please be so kind as to ask her to look into my petition to raise taxes with the King.
I will personally see to it that our nation will recover from this impasse. But King George's mental situation is slowing down our decision-taking.
Thank you in advance for all your help.

Dear friend,
Who is the most admirable of all the Olympians ? None other than the king of the gods of course.
Unlike his father Chronos, he learnt to make equal use of his strength and wisdom.
Instead of fearing the power of his children and brothers, he accepted to share the world with them.
Men fear his thunder and praise his justice. He reigns but doesn't dominate...

My dear Napoleon,
As previously agreed, I would like to ask you to join us, in January, on my island to participate in the high society meeting organized for the occasion.
We shall be able to continue our discussion about our project for a new order for France.
I have a proposition to make to you concerning your wish to put a strong leader at the head of France.
I trust you to be discreet as to your coming.
See you soon.

My dearest son,
I'm writing to implore you to act quickly.
The situation is rapidly worsening here. Paoli continues to steer our motherland, Corsica, toward open warfare between France and England.
His men are everywhere. We are obliged to go into hiding and are unable to remain in the same place for more than two days. I wouldn't be surprised if they targeted us soon.
Make haste, my son. You hold our destiny in your hands.
Your loving mother,
Maria Letizia Bonaparte

Dear friend,
Please come and join us. We must meet about the on-going operations in Paris.
A boat will be waiting for you in Calais and will take you to Dover, in England.
From there, a carriage will take you to the port of Tintagel where a frigate will be waiting for you, and other guests, so you can meet up with me on my island as quickly as possible.
I await your arrival.

Dear Monsieur Péru,
I'm writing to thank you for the funds you sent. These funds will be crucial for the renovation of the western wing of the orphanage.
The children you sent are doing marvelously well and little Pierre will soon be walking.
Some of them still sometimes suffer nightmares about their parents on the scaffold, but I expect they will cease in due course.
Should you decide to send us more, please note that another twenty beds will soon be ready.
The children and myself will never thank you enough.
Long live the Republic, long live France.

I'd like to invite you to join me, as planned, at my place.
I have a project to show you. It is time that the United States played a more important role on the world stage.
I understand your reluctance to play with fire.  I know your new country is very young, but rest assured that I would do nothing to jeopardize what we have built together.
I look forward to seeing you soon.

How many times must I tell you? You must never endanger your life for me!
Mother has always had a fascination for Lord Mortimer, but has never wanted to tell me why.
Please understand that we are doing our utmost to find your mother as quickly as possible.
Without your mother, hundreds of men of the cloth would have gone to the guillotine.
All I can tell you is that I'm looking for my sister.
Do you believe your mother capable of torturing a child?
An agreement for cannons. Lord Mortimer assured me that you are to take over the project, on behalf of your mother.
Johann Christoph von Wöllner, Minister of Religious Affairs
And Jacques Peru, a judge on one of the French Revolutionary Tribunals.

Monsieur de Richet, I am apprehending you for the murder of Elizabeth Adams.
I do apologize for being late; I had some...  urgent business to settle.
The only thing I can tell you is that Sarah had indeed changed.
In your opinion, why would your mother remain in hiding over several weeks?
You must leave me alone now! I have agreed to everything...  Even to... 
But you do realize your mother will have to accept the consequences of her acts.
I hope that your search will prove successful and bring Sarah back to us soon.
I'll be leaving now because whatever it is you're up to, I do NOT want to know .
Since then, we have become one and the same. We have officially erased the identity of my sister, Emma.

quote the note

Analyze the notes

It looks like a method used to control an epileptic fit.
I wonder if Elizabeth is the one being treated for this illness.
