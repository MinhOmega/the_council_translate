The exegesis is extremely detailed, with a lot of information about the life of Jesus.
I'm bound to find something about the Holy Lance!
Let's see if I'm right...
Flip through
This book is much too dense, I need to be more specific...
What elements of the death of Jesus could I use?
The last supper
No, there can't be anything to do with the lance there...
It's much too early...
The trial
There's no mention of the lance during the trial of Jesus.
The resurrection
Not quite specific enough but we're almost there: "the Lord was pierced on his right side by the lance of a centurion..."
Golgotha
Look, it's mentioned here! Of course, the place of the crucifixion!
"The ordeal of Christ ends when Longinus pierces his right side with his shimmering lance"...
A shimmering lance...
It must be made with copper because Longinus was a simple centurion. It'd be inconsistent if it were a noble metal...
What metal shines like that?
Longinus was a simple centurion so it must be decorated with copper. It'd be inconsistent if it were a noble metal...

The betrayal of Judas
"Against his will and with his face bathed in tears, Judas Iscariot accepted the ultimate and terrible mission claimed by the Lord..."
No, this passage has nothing to do with the lance...

Those books must mean the lance which finally took the life of Christ...
Search in the gospels.
The 4 gospels each give an account of the death of Christ. Let's see what they can tell me about the lance...
According to Mathew
There's nothing about the lance in this account of the crucifixion...
According to Mark
This apostle does not mention the lance in his description of the death of Christ..
According to Luke
There's no mention of the lance in what Luke says about the death of Christ...
According to John
Ah there! In John's exegesis...
"When they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs;
But one of the soldiers with a shimmering lance pierced his side, and forthwith there came out blood and water.
And he that saw it bore witness, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe."
"A shimmering lance"... What is this telling me?
Find a clue of what the lance looks like
The medieval hermetic traditions evoked the idea of using noble materials for relics...
Which the monasteries often made themselves, in order to attract pilgrims...
Of course they had to inspire greatness... So here we might think of gold whereas a centurion could not have hoped for anything better than copper at the time!
The true lance would not have been a luxurious weapon...
Know who it is
The name of the Roman soldier who killed Christ never appears in the biblical canon...
Yet, it is said that he was a centurion and was called Longinus...

Your Eminence, would you have a moment to spare?
Not now, Louis...
Please, leave me alone!
I beg your pardon?
I want to be alone!
Very well, I...
I'm only searching for information about the lance of Longinus the soldier. If you could...
You are not listening to me...
You are playing with fire!
I heard you speak to Mr von Wöllner about it and I was wondering if you could tell me something about it.
That was a private conversation!
How could I have known that he was listening to us!!?
I see what you mean...
Louis, don't push it.
Leave while you still can!
Your Eminence? Are you alright?
Your Eminence? Are you with me?
Can you turn around, please?
What do you want to know about the Holy Lance, Louis?
Your Eminence, turn around...
This is the weapon used by a Roman centurion, on the very day Christ was nailed to the cross.
Look at me.
Longinus thrust his lance in the right side of Jesus.
Please...
As you wish.
His nose is bleeding...
So, you are looking for the Holy Lance of Longinus, are you?
Yes
Exactly.
Frank and direct! I like that.
Thank you for not trying to be sly.
No
Of course not, your Eminence.
Come now, Louis, please don't insult me.
It's just a pity that you have no idea why you are looking for it.
What is wrong with him?
Your Eminence, you're worrying me...
What is happening to you?
Nothing, Louis. Just a moment of weakness but I'm better now.
I am all ears.
Only some information
No, no, I... I was wondering about it myself.
Oh Louis, it's even worse than I thought.
I believe you when you say you've only come to find out more.
But in that case, it means that Sarah didn't even tell you the point of it all.
Because, believe me, you are looking for it.
You are looking for the Lance.
You should know, you are not the only one.
Lord Mortimer has spent a good part of his life and his fortune trying to find it.
Never will he let you have it.
But tell me, before going any further...
...have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Yes
My mother
Yes, my mother knows about it.
Of course, Sarah. Who else?
Wöllner
Well, I spoke to Mr von Wöllner about it, why?
Because you are endangering all those who know anything about this Lance, Louis.
Anyone else?
Washington
Briefly with President Washington.
Who knows what exactly?
Absolutely nothing, he advised me to speak to Mr von Wöllner.
Very well. Is that all?
That is all
No one else.
No
No, you are the first I have spoken to about it, your Eminence.
Come, Louis... Are you quite sure of that?
No!
No, no, your Eminence.
I thought you'd be the only one able to help me with it.
Your words lack conviction, Louis.
If I'm asking you all these things, it's for your own good, you know.
You have no reason to lie to me.
Imagine you find it. Which I don't doubt, given how resolute you are when you've got something on your mind.
Then what?
What are you going to use the Lance for, exactly?
Nothing
Nothing in particular, I...
I'd like to study it, that's all.
Louis, please. I'm sure you can do better than that.
I can't answer him
Your Eminence, I regret. I am unable to answer.
Please understand that it... it pains me, but if I answered you, I... I would risk putting you in danger.
Stop running round in circles and just tell me what you would use the Lance for.
To protect myself
I need it.
Why?
You won't understand...
Try me, Louis.
I need to protect myself with it.
To drive away the Demons
If I told you why I needed this Lance, you would never believe it.
Trust me, Louis.
You can tell me anything.
It's our only chance to vanquish the Demons...
Oh my dear God, Louis... you sound just like Sarah!
Do you realize you are following the same path?
Step by step. Sarah also started by imagining things.
She too spoke of Demons, I am told. She could no longer speak to anyone and saw a hidden monster in every guest, lurking in the shadows, ready to devour her.
You must let us help you.
GOOD ANSWER
Louis, thank you for your sincerity.
I shall answer you about Longinus, you deserve to be told.
His spearheaded lance did indeed pierce the side of the Messiah. His blood gushed out covering the head of the lance.
It was completely covered in the blood of Christ.
Thank you. Thank you, your Eminence.
You are welcome, take care, Louis.
You are on a perilous path. Don't follow Sarah's demons, my boy...
Don't delve too deeply into her delusions or you won't be able to come back.
The Demons that she is frantically trying to drive away are in her own mind.
Take good care of yourself. God keep you...
BAD ANSWER
Louis, you should abandon your project.
I say this for your own good. You will only get burnt if you embark on this enterprise
Leave the Lance where it is. Too many people have suffered because of it.
Please excuse me, your Eminence, I'm... I'm in a terrible hurry.
Of course you are, and you won't listen to my advice...
Don't worry about me, your Eminence.
Everything is fine.
That is not the impression you give... minus one of your limbs.
Wait... is he reacting to my arm at last?
Good luck.
Your Eminence, would you have a moment to spare?
Not now, Louis...
Please, leave me alone!

De Richet?
Damn, that's all I need!
Maybe he knows something about the Lance...
What happened? You... You've lost... Ach, how horrible! Your hand!
I... It's an accident... To tell you the truth, I...
An accident? Are you joking? You have lost your hand, Louis!!!
We've got to do something!
It's been done! I've been given treatment, rest assured.
I admit that I didn't truly realize the consequences of my recklessness, so just stay calm...
Yes, yes... of course... but... Louis, it's your hand!
I know! Please!
There's nothing I can do about it. I know, I made a mistake, but it's too late now!
It was an accident. I only wanted to inspect the place to find my mother and, well, I fell into a trap...
The result is appalling, I... I grant you that but...
...at least I can guarantee that we're all perfectly safe here on this island!
And you joke about it?
Am I dreaming...?
No, sir, but let's be realistic...
So many world leaders brought together in one place and there are no safeguards? The error indeed stems from my recklessness.
I went looking here and there in search of my mother and I had an accident... It's my own fault.
Fine. We will drop this... incident? Why are you here?
What are you doing in my room?
Nothing
Don't take it the wrong way, I was just passing through...
Ach! Don't take me for a fool!
As far as I know, I did not invite you.
And I do not much appreciate you entering my quarters like this!
I was looking for you
Sir, perfect timing, I... I was looking for you...
You were looking for me?
Well, here I am. What can I do for you?
I was wondering if you might help me...
I have run out of things to read.
Von Wöllner... Let's not have a misunderstanding, I...
I had nothing else to read in my bookcase and I wondered if I...
Ach! Stop your blathering, de Richet!
The lances!
Well, sir, I see you have some captivating books and...
...you seem to be rather interested in the famous Longinus.
I... it's... what's it to do with you?
I overheard you speaking with Piaggi... What are you two up to exactly?
No, I... Fine! Yes, we are looking for the Holy Lance.
That imbecile has given Mortimer all the ones kept in the private collection of the Holy See!
But it... it's not what you think... I...
Hang on a minute...
Wait... that's my book!
You're the one looking for the Lance!
No, I...
Don't take me for a fool! You are looking for the Holy Lances!
Refer him to the Al Azif
Not at all, I...
I've come here to talk to you about the Al Azif.
Ach, you are lying through your teeth!
You are not here for the Al Azif!
No, of course not.
Wh... What makes you think that?
You are a very bad liar, my lad!
Don't think you're going to get away with it so easily!
Pretend not to
Why, of course not.
What makes you think that?
You are a bad liar, my boy!
Don't think you are going to get away with it so easily!
What are you so afraid of?
What's the matter?
You seem completely panicked at the idea I might be interested in this relic.
I... no! No! That's not true!
What are you so afraid of?
I'm not afraid!
You know Mortimer's got it, so you're not worried that I'd give it back to him.
What are you...?
So why are you so terrified of me being able to find it?
You have no idea what it is you're looking for...
I'm only looking for the right one.
I'm not looking for the Lances of Longinus, von Wöllner.
I'm looking for THE Lance of Longinus. The one that pierced Christ's side.
You are playing with fire!
Don't take it the wrong way, I'll leave you all the copies.
Don't worry about that!
Good answer...
What are you playing at, de Richet?
Mortimer's the one who has that cursed Lance.
How long have you been looking for it?
Ah, I see! You want it, and so you planned to steal it from Mortimer...
For a long time, isn't that right?
Why you little swine! You're planning to give it to Sir Gregory!
You're looking to double-cross me, and Piaggi too!
What on earth is he talking about?
Yes, I want to give it to Holm.
That's right! You can read me like an open book!
I'll find the Lance before you and make you look like a fool in front of Holm!
Hang on... you're trying to pull one over on me... if that was your plan, you wouldn't reveal it so easily!
It must be for something else...
No, you jackass!
Alright, alright! Calm down!
I don't give a damn about getting you in Sir Gregory's bad books!
Look at yourself, goddammit, you're ridiculous!
Shut it!
Don't think you're going to fool me so easily!
If you're not looking for the Lance for Sir Gregory, then why do you want it?
Make up for Piaggi's mistakes?
Mr von Wöllner, would you be so kind as to calm yourself down, please!
All I'm trying to do is make amends for his Eminence's errors.
Sir Gregory should surround himself with better people, if you want my opinion, but Piaggi is a friend of my mother's.
What? I...
You want to help Piaggi?
I just told you, that's what my mother would do if she was here.
I heard you in the corridor and he seemed to be in serious trouble because of the Lances.
I'm only trying to help him.
Ah... alright, Louis.
For you, Wollner.
But calm yourself, goddammit! You're the one I'm trying to help.
What... what?
I heard you talking with his Eminence, and it seemed to me that this story about the Lances had put you in a tight spot.
I was only trying to be helpful.
But why didn't you tell me straight away?
Seeing as I hadn't found it, I... I didn't want to commit myself too quickly.
If I failed, I... I would have looked like a beginner.
I understand, Louis.
GOOD
I thought you were trying to manipulate me.
But please excuse me, I got a little bit carried away.
But you can't get ahead by staying in the shadows on a case like this.
There are already several of us searching for the Lance of Longinus, and it would be smarter to pool our information.
Unfortunately, I've barely made any progress. I'm still trying to find out what the original Lance really looked like.
Ach! Let me reassure you, we've all been there, given the number of copies there are in existence.
It also took us quite some time to discover it's true shape.
Many believe the central part of the head of the Lance to be covered in gold, whereas in truth, its center is made of an alloy of copper and iron.
That does make sense, in those times a centurion wouldn't have any chance of possessing a lance made of gold.
Ah! That is the perversion of Christian idolatry. A copper lance could not have been noble enough to pierce the side of Christ.
Anyway, thank you, sir.
You're welcome, Louis.
Keep me posted as to your research. We're bound to end up recovering it.
I'm counting on it.
See you later.
BAD
Drop it!
I can see very well you're trying to take me for a ride.
You have no idea of what you're getting yourself into, de Richet! Don't think you're going to get off lightly!
Never will I help you find the golden Lance of Longinus! Never!
Don't make me your competition, de Richet. You are no match.
Now, get out of here!
De Richet?
Damn, that's all I need!
Maybe he knows something about the Lance...
What happened? You... You've lost... Ach, how horrible! Your hand!
I... It's an accident... To tell you the truth, I...
An accident? Are you joking? You have lost your hand, Louis!!!
We've got to do something!

Sir Gregory should surround himself with better people, if you want my opinion, but Piaggi is a friend of my mother's.
What? I...
You want to help Piaggi?
I just told you, that's what my mother would do if she was here.
I heard you in the corridor and he seemed to be in serious trouble because of the Lances.
I'm only trying to help him.
Ah... alright, Louis.
For you, Wollner.
But calm yourself, goddammit! You're the one I'm trying to help.
What... what?
I heard you talking with his Eminence, and it seemed to me that this story about the Lances had put you in a tight spot.
I was only trying to be helpful.
But why didn't you tell me straight away?
Seeing as I hadn't found it, I... I didn't want to commit myself too quickly.
If I failed, I... I would have looked like a beginner.
I understand, Louis.
GOOD
I thought you were trying to manipulate me.
But please excuse me, I got a little bit carried away.
But you can't get ahead by staying in the shadows on a case like this.
There are already several of us searching for the Lance of Longinus, and it would be smarter to pool our information.
Unfortunately, I've barely made any progress. I'm still trying to find out what the original Lance really looked like.
Ach! Let me reassure you, we've all been there, given the number of copies there are in existence.
It also took us quite some time to discover it's true shape.
Many believe the central part of the head of the Lance to be covered in gold, whereas in truth, its center is made of an alloy of copper and iron.
That does make sense, in those times a centurion wouldn't have any chance of possessing a lance made of gold.
Ah! That is the perversion of Christian idolatry. A copper lance could not have been noble enough to pierce the side of Christ.
Anyway, thank you, sir.
You're welcome, Louis.
Keep me posted as to your research. We're bound to end up recovering it.
I'm counting on it.
See you later.
BAD
Drop it!
I can see very well you're trying to take me for a ride.
You have no idea of what you're getting yourself into, de Richet! Don't think you're going to get off lightly!
Never will I help you find the golden Lance of Longinus! Never!
Don't make me your competition, de Richet. You are no match.
Now, get out of here!

I don't know but we'd better not hang around.
Say nothing
...
What did she think she was going to find behind that door?
Do you know what we're looking for?
We'd better keep our guard up...
Be careful, Mother... as if me saying that would make any difference...
Knowing Mortimer, I wouldn't be surprised if he'd rigged his crypt with traps.
So you think the door is not enough?
Do you want to wager your other hand?
You've got a point there...
We have to find that weapon...
What do you know about the Holy Lance, Louis?
The what?
The lance of Longinus the centurion...
I don't know
I'm sorry but I don't remember anything specific...
It's the lance with which the Roman centurion pierced the side of Christ on his crucifixion.
I know
Ah, that? That's what we've come to find?
The lance that a centurion stuck in the side of Christ at his crucifixion...
That's it...
Ah, right, I remember
Yes, the centurion that pierced the side of Christ with his lance... That weapon naturally became a holy relic...
Exactly...
That's what Piaggi and Von Wöllner were talking about
Now that you mention it... I did catch von Wöllner in the middle of an altercation with Piaggi...
What?
Von Wöllner blamed his Eminence for having supplied Mortimer with all the lances in the Vatican's possession...
If Mortimer has all of them in his possession, it's not going to help us...
Seriously, you don't really believe that fable, do you?
Every fable is founded on true events.
I'm not saying that everything adds up! But imagine if it really did exist...?
Very well. Now what?
Well, now you know what you need to find!
Pardon?
I have to get to the wharf to prepare our departure. Let's get off this cursed island as quickly as we can. We shall come back when we are ready and armed.
But... hang on...
Louis, let's first get to safety. We shall come back when we have the upper hand, fear not.
You take care of getting the lance, it's imperative! I'll take care of preparing our departure...
Hang on! At least tell me everything you know about this Lance!
But I have never seen it, there's nothing else I can say, Louis!
Well, you can always go snooping around Mortimer's study. I remember seeing paintings of Longinus there...
I want to know why she shot Emma!
Hang on a second!
What's the matter?
Why did you shoot Emily's sister?
Do you really think now is the right time for this?
Insist, goddammit!
I want to know, Mother!
Why did you betray her?
Listen, Louis, I don't think you've really understood my interest in the Al Azif... It's not just simple curiosity about some old relic!
You tried to kill her!
And I had no choice, for crying out loud! It must not fall into the hands of the demons or we are all doomed, don't you see?!
Listen, I don't know exactly what it contains but I prefer to be one step ahead!
If they want it, there must be a reason, and even if I don't know what it is, I want to stop them for safety's sake, no matter what!
Nothing will stop you if I understand correctly, not even...
Enough, Louis! If you could see the extent of their power as I do, then you would understand what I'm saying!
Don't insist, Louis...
Don't insist
Alright... we'll do it your way...
One more thing... if they find you in possession of the Lance, they won't let you get away with it.
Choose only one and hide it under your jacket so you don't get caught with it! Then, run and meet me on the wharf!
And if I get caught?
If they catch you in possession of the Lance, we're all doomed!
Do you understand?
Perfectly.
Good... and go talk to Piaggi! He's the one who probably knows the most about this.
AAAHHHHHHH !!!!!
Louis! Oh my God, no! Louis, hang on!!!
AAAHHHHHHH !!!!!
No, no, NO! Let me see, I have to stop the bleeding!
Louis, stay with me!...
Louis?...
Louis, no! LOUIS!!
Hang in there!! You'll be all right!! Come on!!
...my... my arm...
Nearly finished, come on... hold on!
...I can't... I can't feel my arm...
Stay with me, Louis! Come on!
Filthy swine!!... I'm going to open this damned door and skin you alive!!
You're not going to get the better of us!!
Mother...
Louis! You've come around! How do you feel?
I... It hurts, Mother... I... I... I can't feel my arm...
Louis, I had to cauterize it with what I could find.
Where's my arm?
We'll get through this, Louis, don't worry.
I think I've found a solution, you'll see...
No, we gotta leave... don't.. don't put your arm in there!
Louis, we can't leave without it. It's our last chance!
I need to see this through to the end... I must do it!
We've done it, Louis! Look!
Stubborn as a mule...
Come on, up you get, I'll help you. Easy does it, you've lost a lot of blood.
And now what?
Let's take what we came for!
I want to know how she managed to open it
Wait! I've got to know what I did wrong!
That is one fearsome mechanism.
In fact, if I hadn't watched you beforehand I would never have found the right combination.
Tell me... where did I go wrong?
First, the nails
The three nails. Yes, it's true... They let you open the iris...
Yes, but you still need to find the right theme, don't you? The fresco was a trap.
Apart from the fresco, everything pointed to the Crucifixion. The things that make it possible to activate the mechanism are associated with the crucifixion.
The cross to activate the mechanism and the nails to choose a date.
Then the iris
What did you do once you uncovered the iris?
I matched the icon of the crown of thorns with the town of Golgotha where the Crucifixion took place...
And the end?
... Well... How did you manage to crack the puzzle?
Then I had to link the crown of thorns to the date of the crucifixion, according to the Exegesis...
But I failed to understand the first time... With that theme in mind, I chose 26M which represents the 26th of March...
To conclude, I had to use the armillary sphere to find the moon corresponding to the day of the crucifixion, which turned out to be in the first quarter...
All that was left to do was to link all those elements on the same axis.
I know the first...
Damn, I was sure I had figured out how the lock worked...
Of course, Louis... But you still had to choose the right theme from the start.
It was the crucifixion... I matched its symbol, the crown of thorns, to the place where Christ was nailed to the cross, Golgotha.
I know the first and the second...
But... but I had linked the theme of the crucifixion to its date, its place and its symbol...
You know, I didn't do any better than you on the first go...
And it took two failures to get it right! You needed the middle disk of the lunar calendar, I think...
Let's get through the door
Come on!
Yes, my carelessness has cost me dearly....
Yes... But even so, we haven't time to feel sorry for ourselves, let's not waste another minute, Louis !
Filthy swine!!... I'm going to open this damned door and skin you alive!!

No, nothing here... Just a diplomatic correspondence.
Ah... here... A list.
Of course, it's in Latin, the language of the Church.
Thank you , Mother, for teaching me this language...
All those hours of learning Latin declensions are gonna pay off in the end! Mother will be proud!
Now, this could be interesting... Lanceae sanctae... Various representation criteria, of which are shown the most common throughout the centuries, and in different forms.
If Piaggi's notes are anything to go by, the weapon I'm looking for is shaped like a tapered spear. That should help me identify it.
I'm not able to translate these notes.
Damnit ! I should have followed my mother's advice and spent more time studying the classics!

I must find the Holy Lance
Using the exegesis, I was able to deduce that the lance is made of copper...
According to Wöllner's information, the lance is copper-rimmed...
The exegesis mentions a shiny metal...
I read that the lance should be shiny, but it can't be gold because Longinus was just a simple centurion...
I deduced from the Bible that part of the lance is made of copper...
Wöllner spoke about the golden lance of Longinus...
Piaggi told me it was the shape of a boar spear...

The statue of Longinus shows it in the shape of a leaf...

I noticed a discreet fish symbol engraved on the tip of the lance of the Longinus' statue...
In the biography of Longinus the centurion, the lance is described as being engraved with the symbol of a fish on the tip...

Flavius Aetius...
Inspect the sarcophagus
It was cut a long time ago, you can tell by the rough hacks of the tool and the patina of the stone...
This sarcophagus is very ancient, I'd say it's several centuries old...
The vanquisher of the Catalaunian Plains
I remember : he was the Roman general who defeated Attila and his hordes in the terrible battle of the Catalaunian Plains...
I was once taught something about this man...
Flavius Aetius, the one they call the last of the Romans...
He was assassinated by his own emperor, who was jealous of all his victories.
But how did he end up here?

This sarcophagus is engraved with the name of Clemens III.
Good God! The one whose cross allowed me to enter!
Translate
Clemens III... Clement III in French.
How come his tomb ended up here and not in the Vatican?
I know that name.
That was the pope from the Middle Ages who inspired the Third Crusade...
He gave the Roman people the power to elect their magistrates..
A powerful man who had an eventful reign.
He was basically an anti-pope...
His path to the throne was pretty turbulent, and he had to be enthroned several times!
The result of a long conflict between the papacy and the Holy Empire.
Inspect
This sarcophagus is beautifully made, but ancient...
The stone is marked by the passage of time, but it's really well preserved.

The sarcophagus of Lord Mortimer...
Take a closer look
It's the only sarcophagus in this crypt which appears to bear the Mortimer family name...
What ancestor can it be? There's no inscription...
Inspect the sarcophagus
Let's see what we can find here.
Force open the lid
Ah, great! Now let's see what's inside....
Try to open it
It's far too heavy... I'm not gonna be able to do it on my own!
Inspect it in detail

The sarcophagus has been ravaged by time... It's sort of ageless, I guess...
It's entirely sculpted...
Decipher the inscriptions
These symbols, these grooves... cuneiform script.
This is Humanity's oldest alphabet, the language of Babel. Sadly, no one today even knows how to decipher it...
There's also some text engraved beneath in ancient Greek: Sargon.
Try to understand
Is this the tomb of a king? Judging by all the sculpted symbols of power...
This is really ancient, the... the inscriptions are all eroded...
I don't know what those marks mean... but maybe a prayer or an epitaph.

This one has no name, I wonder who it was for?

Saint Longinus...
Let's take a closer look at his lance...
Observe the lance
It is shaped like a leaf... like the real lance maybe?
How can I be sure?
Take a closer look
Hey... Looks like there's a symbol engraved on the tip...
Yes, a fish... The Christian fish no doubt... It can't be a coincidence, it must have been done on purpose...
Good thing I took a closer look!
Mortimer is a deceiver...
No, this is too easy... Mortimer is trying to throw me off the track again!
It seems too visible to be true: impossible not to see the statue on first glance, given its size...
And Mortimer has no interest in making the shape of the true lance so easy to see!
What should I think?
I think the statue does represent Longinus, armed with the lance that wounded Jesus... The Holy Lance...
How can I find out if this is an exact representation? There's no way of being certain of it...

Read the description
"Adoration of the Shepherds with Saints Longinus and John," Giulio Romano, 1534...
Examine the painting
Longinus is holding the Holy Lance in his left hand... and I'll bet he's holding the sponge soaked in holy blood in the other hand... Yes!
Here we can see that the Holy Lance is represented in the shape of a spear...
Distrust
I'd better make sure I check this twice, it's... it's a work that dates from the Renaissance...
There's nothing to say that it's not based on erroneous elements...
The letter mentioned this...
But I've read Mortimer's letter about this painting...
There's every reason to believe that this painting has been modified according to his guidelines, to represent the true shape of the Holy Lance...
A spear shape...
Recover the information
This work is an order from Lord Mortimer... All the details have been conceived with a specific goal in mind...
Upon closer examination, you can see that even the style clashes with that of most of the other works in the manor!
No, if Mortimer has taken special care as to the conception and exhibition of this painting in his study...
...in the same way as for the Nightmare painting, it must be of some significance.
And that is indeed the true shape of the Holy Lance, a spear shape!
Look for other information from elsewhere
There's only one way of being sure... I'll have to find other clues that will confirm this information.
Leave
Leave with this information
I have an idea of the shape of this lance now.

I can see this lance has...
A spear shape...
It is copper-rimmed...
And it has been engraved with the symbol of the Christian fish on the tip...
Take
There're several spearheads. I need to find clues to pick the right one... Piaggi knows something about it for sure.
I must be sure of my choice, I cannot get it wrong.
Am I absolutely sure this is the one to take?
Choose this lance

Good evening, Mr President.
Good evening.
Bring up the Holy Lance
Hard to kill time on this island. Nothing ever happens. Gets a bit boring, don't you think?
Are you joking, my friend? I'm sure you're just being ironic.
Yes and no... It's true that the manor is full of books and works of art.
Unfortunately, the subjects are restricted to Lord Mortimer's specific tastes: the crusades, religion...
Yes, that's true.
By the way, have you noticed the representations of the Holy Lance he's got all over the place?
Ah no... it was the last thing on my mind to be honest.
Oh... Well, that's a pity, I would have enjoyed chatting about it, as I would have done with my mother.
Ask him directly what he knows about the Holy Lance.
I'm back on the trail of my mother again.
I don't have time to explain, but would you know anything about the Holy Lance?
I... Ah! That's good news, but be careful, Louis. You might end up getting noticed...
Do you know anything or not?
No, I regret I don't... But why not ask von Wöllner? Theology is his field after all.
That's an idea... In that case, I'll try and find him.
You are keeping up the good work, I see... but I'm telling you, keep your guard up. Everyone is rather on edge right now...
You're right... thanks for everything, Mr President.
See you later.
So... let's see what Wöllner has in his bookcase...
Inspect the books
A few works on religions...
Two scientific essays about human thought...
Most of these works are on Alchemy.
"Longini militis fabulam"...
Ah!... what have we here?
It looks like a kind of biography on Longinus the centurion.
Truly, Wöllner has done everything he can to get information about that Lance.
Understand the titles of the books
Not surprising, most of these works are in German.
And one in Latin...  "Longini militis fabulam".
Analyze the works
Oh damnit, most of these works are in German... I don't understand a thing.
Except for this one. Looks like Latin: "Longini militis fabulam".
Longini ?
Inspect in detail
I don't know where to begin, I've... I've never heard of most of these works.
I'd better keep this one, though.
