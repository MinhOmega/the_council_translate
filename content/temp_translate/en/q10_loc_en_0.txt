Right, it's definitely an armillary sphere, but I'll have to find one that I can take with me, otherwise I risk drawing too much attention to my comings and goings.
Now, where can I find a smaller one?... 
Given the size of that armillary sphere, I'm really glad I've found a smaller one.

How does it work, now?
Ask my mother how it works?
Tell me, Mother, you wouldn't know anything that might save me some time, would you?
That's where you'll have to put the Clement III cross.
You insert the cross into the slot and it will open the iris.
But don't do it straightaway. Start by gathering everything together first, because you've seen what happens when you try to go too fast.
Analyze by myself
Let's see if I can work it out myself.
Looks like a kind of control panel.
There's a cross-shaped slot there.

It looks like certain mechanisms I've seen before.
I wouldn't be surprised if I had to put the Clement III cross in it.
Go back
Leave
You ought to go, Louis.
If someone finds us here, the situation might well become seriously complicated.

So that's the Exegesis of Judas... 
I hope Mortimer doesn't read it very often, otherwise he's going to notice that someone's stolen it.
But that's just too bad, I need it.

I got all the keys that my mother asked me to find
I got some information about the Armillary Sphere from Napoleon
I found out that George Washington was still investigating the disappearance of my mother
I cracked the code of the Crypt door

I made the same mistake as my mother
I persuaded Giuseppe Piaggi to lend me his cross
I found my mother's lost cross

Goddammit de Richet!
Are you joking or what? You sell me pipe dreams about Mortimer's project and a few hours later, one of your allies completely breaks down.
Is this what Mortimer's side is all about?
What am I going to do now?
He's got a point there
I admit that things haven't gone exactly as I intended, my Lord Duke.
This is like a bad dream...
Do you realize the impact it's going to have, once we get back home?
You understand we are not here to play games?
Mortimer should never have brought you to our table!
What about him, he declared war on me!!
Oh there's no need to get on your high horse!
We have both had our share of little surprises!
You did not warn me that you were going to declare war, now did you!?
Yes...  no but...  I...
No one could have predicted that Péru would react like that.
Now what's done is done.
It makes no difference to us!
Reassure him
Come now, my Lord Duke, you know very well that at this level things can get pretty rough.
You ought to be used to it.
Rest assured, Lord Mortimer has bounced back before.
It is not an issue.
Monsieur de Richet! I've found this conference at times quite amusing...
Excuse this public humiliation but I think you'll have learned your lesson...
No hard feelings?
As for you...  you lose nothing by waiting!!!
Naturally. It's part of the job, you can't win them all.
Ah, de Richet, congratulations for your efforts with Washington...
I see that Sir Gregory did well to trust you.
Ah, de Richet...
Nice try with George Washington...
You are still a little raw to be able to manipulate an old wolf like him but what could be expected? So don't blame yourself.
You think you could have handled it?
Certainly...
Monsieur de Richet, you are up at last...
I am happy to see it...
Thank you for your concern...
Lord Mortimer speaks very highly of you...
Even though you are not on our side at the conference, I would be inclined to agree with him...
Have you thought it over? I mean, is your choice final?
Technically speaking, I haven't made my choice yet.
Everyone thinks I'm on Mortimer's side... why not, but as I wasn't present for your initial meetings, the truth is, I haven't committed to anything for the moment.
Good news! Sir Gregory will be pleased!!
What can I do for you?
I'm dreaming...
My mother was right, he‘s not going to tell me one word about what happened to Emily.
To tell you the truth, I'm in search of an armillary sphere. You wouldn't know where I can find it, would you?
Well, well...  so you too have a passion for astronomy?
Von Wöllner has already bored me quite enough with all of his endless stories...
You ought to concentrate, Louis. Politics is an art that requires all ones attention. Refrain from spreading yourself too thin and leave stargazing to the poets.
What can I say, I am only...
Ask Wöllner, I am sure he must have it among his effects.
Perfect.
Thank you, my Lord Duke.
Leave me now.
See you later.
Go away!

Go away!
So? Good, you've managed to gather all the keys?
Yes, that's right, I have everything.
What should I start with?
Place the Clement III cross on the console.
Then, you have to put the nails on the disk of the door.
Where to put the nails?
What hole should I put the nails in?
Well,  I can't really advise you there, because I haven't exactly made the best choices myself.
All I can say is that you have to insert:
One to choose a town.
One to choose a chapter.
And one to choose a verse.
Ask her what she chose
What theme did you start with?
As the fresco shows the birth of Christ, I placed one nail in Bethlehem, one in Chapter II and one in Verse 6.
The iris opened a little. I thought it was normal.
Behind the aperture of the iris, there is a duct in which I put my hand. I felt something like a valve at the bottom.
I thought by turning it the door would open, or the iris would open completely, or something else would happen.
Instead, I felt something like an ax cut off my hand.
I really thought it was the end of me.
What did you do then?
Well, although I had made some unfortunate choices, I was lucky in that Mortimer was well stocked with drugs.
I raided his supplies of medicine.
I can begin
Alright, my turn now.
Go ahead, impress me. I'll shut up and let you concentrate.
Leave

The map of Europe.
Someone's written 26 million, in France.
Analyse
It's the estimated population of France.
Mortimer knows very well that France has a higher population than its neighbors.
He is preparing for it to go to war and knows he can make it happen by stirring up the people.
I'm standing in front of a lesson of absolute mastery in military strategy.
Which is absolutely spine-chilling if it turns out that Mortimer is a Demon.

Troops are directed towards Italy.
I get the feeling that Piaggi is going to be in for a hard time.
Mortimer has been planning to invade Italy for a long time.
Yet he seems to be establishing strongholds lined up against Spain.
The fact is, he's always intended for Spain to declare war on France!

If Mortimer's plan succeeds, the United States will indeed double in size.
it would mean the end of the Spanish presence in North America.
If Mortimer's conference is successful, French forces on the North American continent could literally change the balance of competing armies.
I don't understand why Washington would let it happen...

Not too shocked?
I beg your pardon?
About Péru, this morning. I asked you if you weren't too shocked by it all.
Yes
Yes, of course, I...
I still can't believe it.
And neither can I...
How could he do that to us?
There are increasingly fewer and fewer of us on Mortimer's side. I don't see at all how we are going to win the conference.
No
I did what I could.
He made his choice. Tragic, but there it is.
He made his choice, yes, but it puts us in a very sensitive situation!
How are we going to win the conference with just the three of us?
And yourself?
And yourself? Not too shook up?
The only thing that matters to me about that stupid man Péru, is the disastrous situation in which it puts us for the conference vote.
I wonder why Mortimer even allowed him to roam around the manor armed.
He was a veritable public danger!
Indeed, you don't seem to be too affected.
Tell me, I was wondering...
Ask about the Cross
I'm in search of a Cross of Clement the third.
You wouldn't have seen one, would you?
I beg your pardon?
What are you playing at now, de Richet?
Oh, nothing, it doesn't matter...  I'll figure it out.
Ask about the armillary sphere
You wouldn't know where to find an armillary sphere, would you?
Do you really think this is the right time?
Oh, ask Wöllner, I am sure he will know...  what with him being passionate about astronomy, you ought to get on fine together!
Leave me now. I need to think of a solution...
Leave him
I won't keep you any longer.
See you later, monsieur.

Sorry, sir, but Mr Péru is not seeing visitors at the moment.
He's resting and is to see no one.
Good luck.
I have no time to lose, so I may as well not bother him.
I have no time to lose, so I may as well not bother him.
Ah, Louis, come in.
Your timing is impeccable. I wanted to have a word with you.
Here we go...
What can I do for you, your Eminence?
Success
I was wondering how you were getting on in your search for our poor Sarah.
You must have made some progress, I should think?
I am terribly worried about her, you know.
Come on, get out of here, Louis, you are in a hurry...
Any news of her?
Yes
Well, I don't know if you were aware of this, but she was seen near Duchess Hillsborrow's room.
What? You mean she broke into the manor?
For goodness sakes, what is she playing at?
No
Unfortunately not, no.
Are you sure?
He knows the answer to his question
I don't know why, your Eminence, but I get the impression you are asking a question to which you already know the answer.
Let's say I've heard rumors but I prefer to ask you the question directly...
Well, what have you heard exactly?
It would appear that your mother is implicated in the death of the Duchess' twin sister.
And that as she tried to escape, apparently von Wöllner heroically interposed, but after a fierce struggle, Sarah knocked him out.
My mother?...  and Wöllner?
Fighting like two cats in a bag?
You do recall that my mother is an old lady, your Eminence.
And yet you believe such hogwash...  I am surprised at you.
I am only telling you what people are saying, Louis.
I never said I believed it.
What a story, all the same...  twins.
I was always wary of the Duchess anyway.
I did not appreciate the facility with which she would flaunt her assets.
You know, Louis, I don't want to put you on the spot but I sense you are worried and that you are not telling me everything.
But what exactly did you come looking for in my room?
What do you mean?
Louis, I was not born yesterday, you know...
When you came in, I saw in your face a hint of disappointment at finding me here.
I concluded that you were hoping you wouldn't run into me.
You came here for something else.
No, no, you are mistaken. I was just passing by.
I shall leave you, your Eminence, I wouldn't want to take up your time.
As you wish, Louis. See you later.
I'm looking for a cross, your Eminence.
So I thought you might be able to help me.
You are asking me for a crucifix?
You wouldn't want Saint Benedict's, would you?
Success
It's the cross that's commonly used in exorcisms, isn't it?
What does he imagine I am preparing, for crying out loud?
No...  no, I'm looking for one of the crosses of Clement III.
Ah...  very well.
Well, you are in luck, I do indeed have one.
Do you think you could lend it to me for a few hours, please?
First though, you'll have to answer a few questions, my dear fellow.
It's win-win.
I thought you were more charitable, Father.
"Charity begins at home," Louis.
Actually, it's quite simple. You want my cross and I want some answers. I think we ought to get on fine, don't you?
I need that cross, but I must not speak to him about my mother at all costs!
What exactly are you involved in, Louis?
Nothing
Nothing, nothing at all. Why are you going...
Louis, if you expect anything from me at all, I advise you to tell me the truth failing which you may as well leave right now.
I don't know anything either
If only you knew. That's what I've been asking myself everyday since I came to this island.
And, well, most of the time, I haven't the faintest idea.
Louis, I understand that all this may seem unsettling to you but be patient my son.
I am sure that once you've learned the ropes, you will be like a fish in water.
Where was I now?...  Ah, yes...
String him along
Your Eminence, I'm hardly going to teach you the rules.
If you were supposed to know how I spend my days, you would already know, don't you think?
Someone would have let you in on the secret.
Yes, I know but...
You know what it means?...
That I am not supposed to know.
Ever since your arrival, I've seen you rushing about all over the place, apparently trying to find Sarah.
We both know how big this island is.
Even if Sarah was disguised as a bush, she would not be able to escape our vigilance for long.
You must have already found her.
She needs help, Louis. We are friends, she and I.
Won't you just tell me where she is?
I really don't know.
How do you expect me to know? I mean…
If you had been observing me, as you say you have, you would have realized that I have not found her!
Despite the size of the island!
And that makes me worry even more! I can tell you that!
Ah, well, whichever way you want to look at it, the fact is, I sincerely regret that you no longer trust me.
But that being the case, why would I do you a favor?
Never will I tell him!
Your Eminence, I wouldn't tell you anything about my mother.
Even if you tortured me I wouldn't say anything!
Listen to yourself, for heaven's sake...
You are out of your mind. I offer you my help and you accuse me of wanting to torture you...
Certainly not
Your Eminence, I am obliged not to answer you.
If even by mistake, I revealed to you all the trouble my mother had gotten herself into, I would by the same token be putting you in grave danger.
And I just wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
To me? I appreciate your concern, my son.
But you only give me all the more cause for concern.
Is he working for anyone?
Your Eminence, if I were sure that you were not asking me all these questions with the sole intention of passing on my answers to the others,
then I would be able to answer you.
Oh, Louis. How can you doubt my integrity?
Can you swear to God that you will not reveal to Lord Mortimer or Sir Gregory where my mother is located?
Well that all depends on your revelations, Louis.
You see, Sir Gregory and myself are...
Promise me before God.
Wait, no, I...
Promise before God or I will tell you nothing.
Louis, don't be...
Drop it, your Eminence.
We are unable to reach an understanding. Just... never mind.
Louis, tell me at least why you want the Clement III cross.
I am sure that you are aware that this is the cross that Lord Mortimer gave to me when we first met.
That was the day I decided to take the cloth.
It cannot be a coincidence.
Please, I beg you...  why the cross of Pope Clement?
For no reason
Why not?
Believe me, I have no particular reason.
You are lying, Louis.
How do you expect me to trust you?
No, I'm sorry, try something else! Like the truth, perhaps!
To open a gigantic door
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me...
Come, please try, my son.
The cross can help me activate a mechanism that will open a gigantic door hidden in the crypt of the manor...
... with the help of the Exegesis of Judas, the Gutenberg Bible, and some nails.
Indeed...
I trusted you, but enough is enough, Louis!
I do not appreciate being taken for a fool!
I would therefore appreciate it if you would change your tune this very instant!
To stave off evil.
Your Eminence, I sense that evil is rampant in these parts.
Help me, I need protection. Please, let me have the cross.
I beseech you!
Of course, my son. Do not fear, it will give you protection.
Never will I leave a true believer in such depravity.
To pray for my mother
I would like to pray for my mother.
She seems more than ever to need prayers from those who love her.
I am afraid of losing her to her demons, your Eminence.
I won't hide the fact that I am not reassured about her either.
Of course I shall let you have my cross.
Good Outcome
Louis, thank you for trusting me. I shall not forget it.
You can take my cross, here.
But please return it to me once you have finished with it.
Thank you, thank you, your Eminence.
You are a lifesaver.
Bad Outcome
I regret to tell you that I am unable to grant your request. The answer is no.
But fear not, I shall not abandon you.
You seem to be taking the same dark path as Sarah took here. And I know what the outcome will be.
You must leave me now, but remember that I am not abandoning you. I just need a little more time.
Trust me. I will get you out of there.
Just be strong, Louis!
Ah, Louis, come in.
Your timing is impeccable. I wanted to have a word with you.
Here we go...
What can I do for you, your Eminence?
Success
I was wondering how you were getting on in your search for our poor Sarah.
You must have made some progress, I should think?
I am terribly worried about her, you know.
Come on, get out of here, Louis, you are in a hurry...

Yes
Well, I don't know if you were aware of this, but she was seen near Duchess Hillsborrow's room.
What? You mean she broke into the manor?
For goodness sakes, what is she playing at?
No
Unfortunately not, no.
Are you sure?
He knows the answer to his question
I don't know why, your Eminence, but I get the impression you are asking a question to which you already know the answer.
Let's say I've heard rumors but I prefer to ask you the question directly...
Well, what have you heard exactly?
It would appear that your mother is implicated in the death of the Duchess' twin sister.
And that as she tried to escape, apparently von Wöllner heroically interposed, but after a fierce struggle, Sarah knocked him out.
My mother?...  and Wöllner?
Fighting like two cats in a bag?
You do recall that my mother is an old lady, your Eminence.
And yet you believe such hogwash...  I am surprised at you.
I am only telling you what people are saying, Louis.
I never said I believed it.
What a story, all the same...  twins.
I was always wary of the Duchess anyway.
I did not appreciate the facility with which she would flaunt her assets.
You know, Louis, I don't want to put you on the spot but I sense you are worried and that you are not telling me everything.
But what exactly did you come looking for in my room?
What do you mean?
Louis, I was not born yesterday, you know...
When you came in, I saw in your face a hint of disappointment at finding me here.
I concluded that you were hoping you wouldn't run into me.
You came here for something else.
No, no, you are mistaken. I was just passing by.
I shall leave you, your Eminence, I wouldn't want to take up your time.
As you wish, Louis. See you later.
I'm looking for a cross, your Eminence.
So I thought you might be able to help me.
You are asking me for a crucifix?
You wouldn't want Saint Benedict's, would you?
Success
It's the cross that's commonly used in exorcisms, isn't it?
What does he imagine I am preparing, for crying out loud?
No...  no, I'm looking for one of the crosses of Clement III.
Ah...  very well.
Well, you are in luck, I do indeed have one.
Do you think you could lend it to me for a few hours, please?
First though, you'll have to answer a few questions, my dear fellow.
It's win-win.
I thought you were more charitable, Father.
"Charity begins at home," Louis.
Actually, it's quite simple. You want my cross and I want some answers. I think we ought to get on fine, don't you?
I need that cross, but I must not speak to him about my mother at all costs!
What exactly are you involved in, Louis?
Nothing
Nothing, nothing at all. Why are you going...
Louis, if you expect anything from me at all, I advise you to tell me the truth failing which you may as well leave right now.
I don't know anything either
If only you knew. That's what I've been asking myself everyday since I came to this island.
And, well, most of the time, I haven't the faintest idea.
Louis, I understand that all this may seem unsettling to you but be patient my son.
I am sure that once you've learned the ropes, you will be like a fish in water.
Where was I now?...  Ah, yes...
String him along
Your Eminence, I'm hardly going to teach you the rules.
If you were supposed to know how I spend my days, you would already know, don't you think?
Someone would have let you in on the secret.
Yes, I know but...
You know what it means?...
That I am not supposed to know.
Ever since your arrival, I've seen you rushing about all over the place, apparently trying to find Sarah.
We both know how big this island is.
Even if Sarah was disguised as a bush, she would not be able to escape our vigilance for long.
You must have already found her.
She needs help, Louis. We are friends, she and I.
Won't you just tell me where she is?
I really don't know.
How do you expect me to know? I mean…
If you had been observing me, as you say you have, you would have realized that I have not found her!
Despite the size of the island!
And that makes me worry even more! I can tell you that!
Ah, well, whichever way you want to look at it, the fact is, I sincerely regret that you no longer trust me.
But that being the case, why would I do you a favor?
Never will I tell him!
Your Eminence, I wouldn't tell you anything about my mother.
Even if you tortured me I wouldn't say anything!
Listen to yourself, for heaven's sake...
You are out of your mind. I offer you my help and you accuse me of wanting to torture you...
Certainly not
Your Eminence, I am obliged not to answer you.
If even by mistake, I revealed to you all the trouble my mother had gotten herself into, I would by the same token be putting you in grave danger.
And I just wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
To me? I appreciate your concern, my son.
But you only give me all the more cause for concern.
Is he working for anyone?
Your Eminence, if I were sure that you were not asking me all these questions with the sole intention of passing on my answers to the others,
then I would be able to answer you.
Oh, Louis. How can you doubt my integrity?
Can you swear to God that you will not reveal to Lord Mortimer or Sir Gregory where my mother is located?
Well that all depends on your revelations, Louis.
You see, Sir Gregory and myself are...
Promise me before God.
Wait, no, I...
Promise before God or I will tell you nothing.
Louis, don't be...
Drop it, your Eminence.
We are unable to reach an understanding. Just... never mind.
Louis, tell me at least why you want the Clement III cross.
I am sure that you are aware that this is the cross that Lord Mortimer gave to me when we first met.
That was the day I decided to take the cloth.
It cannot be a coincidence.
Please, I beg you...  why the cross of Pope Clement?
For no reason
Why not?
Believe me, I have no particular reason.
You are lying, Louis.
How do you expect me to trust you?
No, I'm sorry, try something else! Like the truth, perhaps!
To open a gigantic door
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me...
Come, please try, my son.
The cross can help me activate a mechanism that will open a gigantic door hidden in the crypt of the manor...
... with the help of the Exegesis of Judas, the Gutenberg Bible, and some nails.
Indeed...
I trusted you, but enough is enough, Louis!
I do not appreciate being taken for a fool!
I would therefore appreciate it if you would change your tune this very instant!
To stave off evil.
Your Eminence, I sense that evil is rampant in these parts.
Help me, I need protection. Please, let me have the cross.
I beseech you!
Of course, my son. Do not fear, it will give you protection.
Never will I leave a true believer in such depravity.
To pray for my mother
I would like to pray for my mother.
She seems more than ever to need prayers from those who love her.
I am afraid of losing her to her demons, your Eminence.
I won't hide the fact that I am not reassured about her either.
Of course I shall let you have my cross.
Good Outcome
Louis, thank you for trusting me. I shall not forget it.
You can take my cross, here.
But please return it to me once you have finished with it.
Thank you, thank you, your Eminence.
You are a lifesaver.
Bad Outcome
I regret to tell you that I am unable to grant your request. The answer is no.
But fear not, I shall not abandon you.
You seem to be taking the same dark path as Sarah took here. And I know what the outcome will be.
You must leave me now, but remember that I am not abandoning you. I just need a little more time.
Trust me. I will get you out of there.
Just be strong, Louis!

Let's see what combination corresponds to the chosen theme.
Guess the right date
By following the clues in the Bibles and the architect's notes...
The resurrection took place on the 14th of Nissan 3793 according to the astronomers of that time. That would correspond to April 1st in the year 33 on a modern calendar.
The crucifixion took place on the 8th of Nisan 3793 according to the astronomers of that time. That would correspond to March 26th in the year 33 on a modern calendar.
Guess the right moon
According to the architect's notes and the armillary sphere...
The moon during the resurrection was a waxing gibbous. That's the one on which the shadow on the right is just a small crescent.
The moon during the Crucifixion was a first quarter. That's the one with its left half in the light.
Guess the right icon
To follow the resurrection theme, I should select the halo.
To follow the crucifixion theme, I should select the Crown of thorns.

What on earth is that?
A disk with information engraved in the metal.
An iris that should open, I imagine.
And blood...
Speak about the outer disk
There are Roman numbers, Arab numbers and town names.
Go on, I am listening.
What do you think ?
Think about the names of the towns
All the towns mentioned have something to do with Christ, haven't they?
Golgotha, Bethlehem, Nazareth...
Exactly.
Analyze the mechanism
Tell me, I imagine that once we've solved this enigma, the iris opens, right?
Exactly.
Make the connection with the nails
How many nails are needed again?
Three.
One nail per type of information, I'm guessing.
In other words?
Well, a nail must be placed on a Roman numeral, one nail on an Arabic numeral and one nail on a town.
Well done, Louis.
There are some holes
On each engraved piece of information, there is a hole.
Those are for the nails, right?
That's absolutely right.
Nothing
Frankly? Not much.
It's not going to be easy.
So start by fetching all the keys, then.
Go back
Speak about the iris
Did you succeed in opening the iris?
Yes, by putting the cross on the console and the three nails on the disk, the iris opens.
It gives access to a hole where I put my hand, thinking I could fully open the iris.
There's a handle at the bottom. And as you can see, it didn't turn out very well for me.
Speak about the blood
Mother? The dried blood, there...
Yes, yes... It's mine...
Sorry if I stained everything but I must admit that, at the time, my thoughts were more on the pain than cleaning up after myself.
Leave
I don't want to hurry you but perhaps it's time you left, Louis.
I'm going, I'm going...
Louis, stop playing with that door. Hurry up and go fetch all the keys.

Analyze the fresco
The fresco clearly shows the birth of Christ...
Louis, I can assure you that it is not the solution to this enigma!
This fresco's only purpose is to mislead, I know that now!
Please...  Focus on another theme about Christ.
I'll have to trust her...
Analyze the fresco
Yes, it's definitely a representation of the birth of Christ, but some of the details have flaked away.
I can't see any other clues...  One thing is for sure, this enigma deals with the life of Jesus, like my mother said.
Notice the details
You can see that the paint has come off in parts...  Difficult to see what was there but I can distinguish the letters N.R.I...  nothing more.
Understand the acronym N.R.I
Why, of course, they are part of the initials INRI, that you can find on the cross of Jesus at his crucifixion.
Understand the acronym N.R.I
Why, of course, INRI: Iesvs Nazarenvs, Rex Ivdæorvm ! These are the initials that stand for Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews.
This is the inscription which appears on the cross at the crucifixion of Jesus.
Go back
Deduce a theme idea
If Mortimer deliberately set a trap by showing the birth of Christ, then maybe the solution is the contrary...  The death of Christ in that case?
Go back to the main menu
Insert the nails
Hmm...  Interesting
Louis...  Be very careful. I got the same result just before losing my arm.
It works!
I hadn't seen those different wheels...  But...  I don't know, I find this theme too close to the one that I used...
Well done, Louis! I hadn't seen those other wheels...  Try connecting the theme to see if it goes all the way...
Analyze the whole door
Looks like there are three types of inscriptions...
Mother told me to put the nails in this wheel but there aren't any holes...  Maybe if I place the cross...
Find out how it works
There are three styles of writing and I've got three nails...
There must be a link...  I must surely put in one nail per category...
Read the inscription
Clearly, we have names of towns, Arabian numerals and Roman numerals...
Recognize the towns
These towns have one thing in common...  they're all related to the life and death of Jesus...
For example, Jordan is the place of the Baptism of Christ.
Go back to the main menu
Put in your hand
I can feel the lever at the bottom.
Louis, don't be a fool! I told you that using the birth of Christ was a bad idea! Don't do it!
Are you sure you've chosen the right theme, Louis?
... Good luck.
Pull the lever
I never doubted you, my son.
Checked
Take out your arm
Phew!...  That was a close one!!!
Louis...  You frightened me.
Looks like I've got another chance to find the right solution...  just barely, though!
Leave your arm in
Ahhhhhhhhh
Louis!!!!
Take out your arm
Analyze the inside wheels
There must surely be a connection between the wheels.
Analyze the wheel of the icons
There are different icons on this wheel. But it looks like some of them can't be connected to the other wheels.
Recognize the icons
I think I can make out each one of the icons apart from the one covered in blood...
Going clockwise from the one I just mentioned, we have the halo that represents the RESURECTION...
The waves represent the BAPTISM of Jesus.
It's more difficult to identify the next one...  Maybe a crib and in that case it's surely linked to the BIRTH of Christ...  The red herring that my mother followed...
Then, a symbol represents the crown of thorns, that Jesus wore during his CRUCIFIXION.
The dove also represents the BAPTISM...  Certainly another red herring.
Then comes the symbol of the TRINITY.
And finally, the candle that must stand for the LAST SUPPER.
Analyze the number of icons
Now, given the difference between the number of icons and the number of towns, I think that only one path connects all the wheels with one another...
Let's try to connect the theme I've chosen with the rest.
Ask advice from Sarah
Mother, what do you think?
As I told you, I didn't get that far...
Nevertheless, these icons do represent moments in the life of Christ.
Go back
Go back to the main menu
Analyze the wheel of the dates
This wheel contains several symbols made up of one or two figures, and one letter.
Deduce what it stands for
The highest figure does not exceed 31 and each letter corresponds to a month of the year: A for April, M for March...
I think these symbols must represent a specific date.
Go back
Go back to the main menu
Analyze the wheel of the moons
This wheel represents the different moons.
Analyze the moons
The totally black moon corresponds to the new moon. So, going clockwise, we have:
The waning crescent
The last quarter
The waning gibbous
The full moon
The waxing gibbous
The first quarter
And lastly, the waxing crescent
The North is indicated for each of them. So, if the shadow goes from west to east, it means it is progressing from left to right...
Symbols of the moons
In the occult sciences, we represent the full moon by an X. As for the DARK moon, called the NEW MOON, in cults it's often associated with something harmful.
Go back
Go back to the main menu
Look at the mechanism
Look at this! There are notches between each of the wheels!

During New Moon, the moon is entirely in the shadow. Then, the shadow moves from West to East, meaning Left to Right, and goes through the following states:
Waxing crescent, First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full moon, Waning gibbous, Last quarter, Waning crescent, and the cycle starts over with the full shadowed New Moon.

What's up, Louis?
Have you seen the inside wheels?
No...  I couldn't explain what the armillary sphere was for: now I see those moons, I understand!
You ought to ANALYZE the wheels!
Can you help me ?
Can you remind me what you did?
I started by putting the Clement III cross in the lectern...
Given that the fresco represents the birth of Christ,
I used the exegesis to find a chapter, a verse and a place corresponding to this theme...
Then I placed a nail to mark my choice in each of the three categories
The iris of the door opened and I could insert my arm...
But it was a trap! I've thought about it since...
For the cross and the nails, I am sure it's the right way...
But I made a mistake in my choice of theme: the birth of Christ was not the right solution...
The fresco was painted uniquely to mislead us!
You need to start off with the right theme, Louis!
The documents that you recovered might help you. The lexicon of the exegesis of Judas contains numerous...
And don't forget the architect's note I gave you!
Can you help me?
Sorry, but I won't speculate given what you risk...  I would never forgive myself...
You have all the elements, including the architect's note that I gave you earlier...  but above all, I have faith in you, Louis...
Quit
Exit
Alright, come on, let's get out of here...  6466 if I remember correctly...
Stay

Alright, come on, let's get out of here...  6466 if I remember correctly...

The ring of the Nibelungs
Even if Mortimer is several centuries old, I don't see what part he has in this legend.
The ring of the Nibelungs
Even if Mortimer is several centuries old, I don't see what part he has in this legend.
Reassure me, we aren't gonna have to force that one, are we?
I don't think we're even capable of doing it.
You're going to have to find a way to open it.
Why, of course...
And what's inside?
Something to vanquish them with?
Perfect.
So?
How does it open?
We'll need several keys.
I found a note from the architect who conceived the mechanism in Mortimer's secret study.
We have to first gather five objects before we try anything.
Are the five objects the keys?
Exactly.
We have the Clement III cross, the nails, the Gutenberg Bible, the Exegesis of Judas, an armillary sphere and all we need to match up the dates between the different calendars.
A cross?
Why a cross?
Well, I haven't the foggiest idea, but it just so happens that's what you are going to use to activate the mechanism.
I found the one Mortimer kept. It belonged to Cardinal Guibert, better known by the name of Pope Clement III.
Perfect, where is it?
Unfortunately, I've lost it.
When I lost my hand I went dashing out and it must have fallen from my pocket.
She ought to make an effort to remember
Remember, Mother, I'm certain you can remember.
Let me think...
You were running...
I was bleeding to death...
You remember the pain...
I thought I was going to faint.
Yes, I remember.
I don't think it can be far, can it?
Would you have lost it outside?
No, I don't think so. It must be in the area. I don't remember going up with it.
Perfect, I'll search the crypt before leaving.
Continue
Well, otherwise I can... I can always go and see Piaggi. He's... he's a cardinal after all.
But you lost it.
How do you know that?
Because I found it, would you believe that?
Well done, my son, so you've already got one of the keys.
Some nails?
Some nails?
Don't ask me, I'm not the one who made the mechanism, you know.
When I arrived, there were already a few of them inserted, so I didn't have to worry about those...
On the other hand, I remember seeing some in Mortimer's secret study, behind his nightmare.
They were in a golden cup, beside some chicken legs.
In a Golden cup, yes... Yes, I saw them too.
Perfect. It will be easy for you to find them, then.
You need three of them.
Very well.
You remember what to do about the rollers?
1191 to enter and 6466 to exit.
Of course...
The Exegesis of Judas.
An Exegesis...  Anything else?
Mmm...  You...
Did you manage to vanquish the Medusa?
To open the chimney? Yes, absolutely.
So you've already come across it. It's the Bible of Judas that is exposed in the secret room, behind the chimney.
Why do they call it an Exegesis?
Because that's what it is, and not an Apocryphal Bible strictly speaking...
It's the study of a text, with a summary, not an actual Bible.
Anyway, well done for the Gorgon. You did well, you didn't get tricked by the light bouncing back!
Thanks...
Do you think I can take it safely?
We haven't got a choice, Louis. Without it, we won't be able to work out this cursed mechanism.
Others?
The Gutenberg Bible?
This is the book in which you left your correspondence with Duchess Hillsborrow, isn't it?
That's right.
You still believe it's in the Tower room, don't you?
I don't know, there is only one way to find out, though.
Right, I shall go and see.
An armillary sphere?
There's one in the portrait gallery.
Yes, but it's enormous.
If you don't want to have to go back and forth several times, then I suggest you get a smaller one.
What did you do then?
I didn't think I'd need one...  I started without one and I lost my hand before I did need one!
And you can see the result...
Dates?
What do you mean by: the concordance of dates, exactly?
Don't worry about that, we already have them.
They are written on the back of the message I just gave you.
Go back
That's it for my questions
So, you have the architect's note. Behind, you will find the correspondences for the dates.
Look, these are the nails we'll be needing.
As for the exegesis, that's behind the chimney, in the portrait gallery.
You'll find the Gutenberg Bible in the Tower room. It's an unoccupied room on the guest floor.
As for the armillary sphere, there's one in the portrait gallery.
Have you seen the size of it? You'll have to find a smaller one that you can carry with you.
Mr von Wöllner is there, I think, isn't he?
Indeed, he is. Do you think he might have one?
Yes, it's highly possible. He is known to have a keen interest in the occult and astronomy.
Go and see if he's got one in his baggage, you never know.
One last thing before you go.
Be very careful, if you come across anyone...
They can all potentially be spies of Mortimer or Holm.
Don't ever confide in anyone because a Demon can slip inside them at any moment.
Wait, not all of them, though. Take Washington...
Especially Washington! He's been conditioned by Mortimer for years.
Look at them, for crying out loud!
How do you explain their behavior otherwise?
The most influential politicians in the western world gather together, without the least protection...
...  without a single aide to assist them, to participate in a conference during which the guests start dropping like flies!
Me! Adams! Péru! Hillsborrow! Look at the number of calamities that have happened over the past few days.
And not ONE of them has asked to leave the island! Do you find that normal?
You'll see! Go up to the manor to look for the keys and I wager not ONE of them will speak to you about my being in Emily's room!
Do you think so?
Go on, you'll see.
And come back with all the objects in one go! Time is against us.
And remember, the code to get out of the secret office is 6466!
Reassure me, we aren't gonna have to force that one, are we?
I don't think we're even capable of doing it.
You're going to have to find a way to open it.
Why, of course...
And what's inside?
Something to vanquish them with?
Perfect.
So?
How does it open?
We'll need several keys.

Perfect. It will be easy for you to find them, then.
You need three of them.
Very well.
You remember what to do about the rollers?
1191 to enter and 6466 to exit.
Of course...
The Exegesis of Judas.
An Exegesis...  Anything else?
Mmm...  You...
Did you manage to vanquish the Medusa?
To open the chimney? Yes, absolutely.
So you've already come across it. It's the Bible of Judas that is exposed in the secret room, behind the chimney.
Why do they call it an Exegesis?
Because that's what it is, and not an Apocryphal Bible strictly speaking...
It's the study of a text, with a summary, not an actual Bible.
Anyway, well done for the Gorgon. You did well, you didn't get tricked by the light bouncing back!
Thanks...
Do you think I can take it safely?
We haven't got a choice, Louis. Without it, we won't be able to work out this cursed mechanism.
Others?
The Gutenberg Bible?
This is the book in which you left your correspondence with Duchess Hillsborrow, isn't it?
That's right.
You still believe it's in the Tower room, don't you?
I don't know, there is only one way to find out, though.
Right, I shall go and see.
An armillary sphere?
There's one in the portrait gallery.
Yes, but it's enormous.
If you don't want to have to go back and forth several times, then I suggest you get a smaller one.
What did you do then?
I didn't think I'd need one...  I started without one and I lost my hand before I did need one!
And you can see the result...
Dates?
What do you mean by: the concordance of dates, exactly?
Don't worry about that, we already have them.
They are written on the back of the message I just gave you.
Go back
That's it for my questions
So, you have the architect's note. Behind, you will find the correspondences for the dates.
Look, these are the nails we'll be needing.
As for the exegesis, that's behind the chimney, in the portrait gallery.
You'll find the Gutenberg Bible in the Tower room. It's an unoccupied room on the guest floor.
As for the armillary sphere, there's one in the portrait gallery.
Have you seen the size of it? You'll have to find a smaller one that you can carry with you.
Mr von Wöllner is there, I think, isn't he?
Indeed, he is. Do you think he might have one?
Yes, it's highly possible. He is known to have a keen interest in the occult and astronomy.
Go and see if he's got one in his baggage, you never know.
One last thing before you go.
Be very careful, if you come across anyone...
They can all potentially be spies of Mortimer or Holm.
Don't ever confide in anyone because a Demon can slip inside them at any moment.
Wait, not all of them, though. Take Washington...
Especially Washington! He's been conditioned by Mortimer for years.
Look at them, for crying out loud!
How do you explain their behavior otherwise?
The most influential politicians in the western world gather together, without the least protection...
...  without a single aide to assist them, to participate in a conference during which the guests start dropping like flies!
Me! Adams! Péru! Hillsborrow! Look at the number of calamities that have happened over the past few days.
And not ONE of them has asked to leave the island! Do you find that normal?
You'll see! Go up to the manor to look for the keys and I wager not ONE of them will speak to you about my being in Emily's room!
Do you think so?
Go on, you'll see.
And come back with all the objects in one go! Time is against us.
And remember, the code to get out of the secret office is 6466!
Louis, I already told you.
Quickly go and find the cross, the nails, the Bible, the Exegesis and an armillary sphere.
The lantern is already in the right position, turned toward the shield... 
The lantern is already in the right position, turned toward the shield... 
That statue is not positioned correctly.
Swivel the statue round
Toward the hero with the Shield
Toward the hero with the Sword
The Gorgon always attacks the best protected.
Toward the hero with the Lantern
Go back
Move away

That's good, the statue is already in the right place.
Shield toward the sword.
That's good, the statue is already in the right place.
Sword toward the Gorgon, that's good, it's in the right place.
Sword toward the Gorgon, that's good, it's in the right place.
Given all the relics preserved here, it wouldn't surprise me if Mortimer claimed it is Excalibur.

The Bible is still there!
The Bible is still there!
A hand of tarot cards.
Read the hand.
The Emperor, symbol of power and stability.
Temperance which expresses a reward.
And the Chariot... that evokes triumph.
If this hand is anything to go by, Mortimer's destiny promises to be glorious..
Leave
I should have learned my lessons in card reading a little better.

Ah, Louis! Glad you are here!
Blast it, he's going to talk about my mother...
Come and see what I've found!
There are pieces of paper in the ashes of the chimney. Someone's been burning something here...
Incredible... he doesn't seem to want to speak to me about what happened between my mother and the Hillsborrow sisters...
Show me a little...
Look! It's possible to distinguish two different writing styles!
The rest of the correspondence between my mother and Emma...
Someone tried to burn an exchange of messages! I am certain!
There must be more...
Shit... what on earth is he doing?...
Diversion
Ah, I see...
I know what it's about!
Do you know who was doing their communicating in this room?
Yes... But of course we must keep it to ourselves, because it is still a sensitive matter...
Wöllner and Elizabeth had an affair...
Wöllner hinted that he'd found a way to remain discreet about it.
I admit, it is ingenious...
Well, I would never have guessed...
Delighted to have helped, but I still have to find my mother...
Of course... We shall see each other later in that case...
Manipulate
If you want my opinion, a servant must have burnt some old papers, that's all...
Why, of course!
You very nearly made me think that you were trying to hide something, Louis...
No, I'm sure there must be other hidden messages!
Tell the truth
There were...
Pardon?
There were more... Emma and my mother communicated through messages in this room.
I found their correspondence and I preferred to burn it all so as not to leave any traces.
But, why didn't you say so?
That's what I'm doing now, Mr President.
Before, well, it all seemed unimportant compared to everything that had happened.
I... yes, you are right.
Moreover, we ought to lend a helping hand...
I shall have a word with Lord Mortimer, because the conference must not make us forget about Sarah.
No! No, thank you, no, I certainly don't want Mortimer giving me any more attention than he is at the moment...
Thank you. Thank you, Mr President.
If you don't mind, I'll take care of it.
As you wish.
Keep persevering. I shall see you later.
Wasted enough time, the Bible!
He won't let go! He's going to work his way back to the Bible if he continues...

Hey! Look! There...
Mmm... no... I don't see anything...
Come, Louis! Look! Someone's clearly drawn a 4 in the dust....
I have a clue!
I'd better take the Bible before he works his way back to it!
He's going to be disappointed when he sees the Bible has disappeared!

An armillary sphere!
Perfect, that will save me some time!
I only hope that he isn't going to realize it right away!
