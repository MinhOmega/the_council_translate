We must be gone before the next guests arrive.
See you soon.

My dear friend,
The latest news from our Corsican friends is not very reassuring.
Would you be so kind as to go there promptly in order to remind our friend Paoli of our respective arrangements?
The Sardinian expedition must be a fiasco for the French army and I am anxious about young lieutenant Bonaparte's determination to shine more than necessary.
I shall leave you to take care of it.
Kind regards,
Sir Gregory Holm.

Dear Lord Mortimer,
I am writing to ask you to persuade President Washington not to sign the Fugitive Slave Act, as it stands.
We must absolutely legislate on a national level and not allow every State to choose their policy regarding slaves.
It was initially intended to resolve a conflict between Pennsylvania and Virginia, by signing it we risk legislating the hunting of blacks.
More and more men of little faith are becoming slave hunters. And, unable to find any slaves on the run, they kidnap the first black they come across which they pass off as the wanted runaway.
The situation threatens to quickly degenerate.
Thank you in advance.
Your friend,
John Adams
P.S. Say hello to my daughter, Elizabeth, for me.

Dear Lord Mortimer,
I regret to inform you that our plans in Poland are set to fail.
Russia and Prussia are working in cohort to bleed our dear Poland.
We have no power here.
We continue to maintain pressure as best we can on the Prussian border as agreed in order to occupy Frederick William's army, but I do not know how long we can keep it up.

Dear Lord Mortimer,
Be assured of my entire devotion.
As agreed, the Vendée peasantry will soon rise up.
My network is striving to increase the pressure on the masses.
The decision of the Assembly which consists of voting the civil constitution of the clergy is inflaming the region.
The people overwhelmingly reject the priests, and swear loyalty to the State.
If you could ensure that the Convention will administer the final blow to the people, the issue will be resolved.
Without wishing to direct you, a forced recruitment for a faraway conflict would be a perfect way to arouse the people definitively.

Sir,
Your plans to intervene in Belgium are to go ahead as set down.
I am to occupy the Prussian army.
Your delivery of cannons to Valmy has ensured our victory.
As agreed, I have notified the King of Prussia of the invasion plans of Custine and the Army of the North,
I will keep the Austrians out of Belgium.
I am to quickly return to Paris as I sense the fate of our King Louis is about to be decided dishonorably and it is impossible for me not to intervene.
Should you have any missives to give to me, I invite you to go by, as per usual, our friend, Monsieur Péru.
Sincerely yours,
Charles-François Dumouriez, General of the Army of the North.

My dear friend,
Thank you for your words and I do understand your situation.
I regret having to confront you militarily,
but if the situation obliges me to declare war, then do what you think fit.
Under your advisement and with a weary heart, I am off to meet up with the coalition that opposes you.
In the hope of serving you again.

My dearest Lord Mortimer,
I regret to inform you that it will soon be impossible to ignore pressure from the Russians.
The Czarina Catherine has every intention of supporting the Count of Provence and will recognize him as the regent of the Kingdom of France,
once King Louis has disappeared from the political stage.
I am sorry to announce bad news but expect dark times ahead.

William,
Whatever your projects, it would seem that our father is against leaving you with a grip on Europe.
Russia will soon commit itself to the coalition against your dear France.
Don't think you can resist for long.
I beseech you, William, not to persist, you are tearing our family apart.
You loving brother.
G.
P.S. I shall come to your conference but do you think that holding it at the present moment is conductive?

My dearest friend,
Our plans are going ahead wonderfully well. The Coinage Act has been voted,
your project of founding the very first bank of America should not be delayed and will probably be called Union Bank.
As for the construction of the White House, it is still die to begin in October.
I will accept no delays, you can trust me on this.
I hope to see you soon.

My dear friend,
With thanks for your services rendered and help in the fight against the Spanish and the conquest of Oran,
a ship bound for Marseilles, in France, has been chartered.
Hidden aboard are a few corpses infected with the plague that is decimating our country at this moment in time.
Be very careful when handling these boxes because if inadvertently opened,
you risk spreading the disease all over France.

My Lord,
I hope this letter will reach you. My hours are numbered.
My printing house has been confiscated and I am imprisoned in the fortress of Shlisselburg.
If by chance, you could intervene in my favor, I would be eternally in your debt.
The Czarina Catherine should not be long in banning all Golden Order lodges from her territory.
Our horizon has become considerably darker...

My dear Louis,
I am writing in the knowledge that you will never be able to read my letter, but I must write it.
Leave the Order. Flee Paris and its private salons. If you want to be happy, if you want to have a chance to live, give up everything at once and disappear!
I would love for you to be by my side. I have so much to tell you that I haven't said before.
I apologize for your harsh upbringing.
I was determined that you would be able to continue my fight. I had planned a great future for you.
But it is all a farce. I was mistaken. I was playing a game without knowing all the rules, and I lost.
But I want you to know that I did everything I could to save you. I'm so angry with myself.
Live, Louis, just live!
And whatever happens, stay as you are.
