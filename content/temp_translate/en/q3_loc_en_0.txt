Excuse me... Monsieur de Richet?
I really need to talk to you.
Is this about last night?
No, that was just a misunderstanding. I'm sure it was a little bit my fault, too...
There's no excuse for that man's horrible behavior. You ought to tell Sir Holm.
Look... The only thing that I care about is that I've lost something precious.
I'm not worried about Jacques Péru...
Hello. You're Elizabeth Adams, aren't you?
Yes. I regret that we haven't been properly introduced.
Give back her talisman
You didn't happen to lose this, did you?
Where did you find it?!!
In the small salon.
It's the only reminder I have of my beloved sister. I thought that swine stole it from me.
Ask if she feels better
How's your eye?
I've had worse.
Please accept my apologies if... I'd stepped in sooner, you … wouldn't have gotten that.
Apologize for not doing anything
I'm... I'm sorry. I should have stopped him from beating you.
What's done is done. It was my fault, not yours.
Don't say that, it's never the victim's fault! Look at your eye...
Say nothing
Bring up her malaise in the salon
You had us all worried last night. How are you feeling today?
Better. I was just a bit queasy. Don't worry about it, it happens all the time.
Take an interest in her health
Do you often fall ill like that?
Yes, sometimes. But don't worry, I... I guess I'm kind of a frail flower.
Maybe you were feeling hungry?
No, it was nothing to do with being hungry.
Fatigue probably. I've been feeling more and more exhausted lately.
Well, get some rest, then, Elizabeth. Take advantage of the sea air and you'll soon get your strength back.
Ask her about her eye
If you don't mind me asking, what happened to your eye?
I had a bad fall.
Looks more like a punch to me.
Say nothing
You're her son. Sarah de Richet's son.
Yes. Why?
My eye's nothing.
Do you really wanna know what made me ill?
Last night, I found out that your mother was on the island.
What you are doing here?!
Ask why she's interested
Excuse me, but speaking frankly … why would you care?
Admit your mother has gone missing
My mother came here to do business with Lord Mortimer. But she seems to have gone missing.
So I'm here to find her.
Change the subject
Same as everyone else, I accepted Lord Mortimer's invitation.
I know your mother very well.
Say that you know
If I understand rightly, you... share a common past.
Are you saying I've made it all up?
What do you mean?
Really?
Yes. I have been in your mother's care ever since I was born.
She nursed you?
Oh, I wouldn't say nursed, no. I remember her stare. Cold as ice.
Her sadistic hands pressing over my mouth to silence me while I screamed in pain.
I remember her knees, too. She held me down with them while she cut and burned scars into me.
Hold on a minute! What do you mean?
You can ask her when you see her!
She's getting more and more agitated...
Examine Adams
And next you're gonna tell me my mother's also responsible for that scar on your head.
My heart stopped twice during the operation.
I lost my memory for six months. You obviously have no idea of the abuse your mother inflicted on me.
Wait, there must be some kind of mistake...
My only mistake was ever meeting your mother.
She's able to describe every detail without hesitation or getting... flustered.
It's becoming difficult not to believe the poor girl.
It's obvious Elizabeth is not lying.
Look, I've... I've gotta go.
Wait...
I need to know more about you and my mother.
Why did she put you through all that?
There must be some reason for what she did.
What's the point of rubbing salt in the wounds?
To understand my mother
There's no way my mother just did that to you out of spite.
However horrible the things she did were, I've... I've got to believe she did it in … your best interest.
Do you have any idea how stupid that sounds?
To find out the truth
I want to find out what really happened.
No, you really don't want to know what your mother did when I shed my first blood at puberty.
On the contrary, you can tell me anything. Let me be my own judge!
To allow her to confide
Elizabeth, confiding in me, might ease your burden.
Let me relieve you of some of your suffering.
Relieve me? Do you even hear yourself?
Do you really think that by confiding in my torturer's son, I will be healed as if by magic?
That it will bring my smile back or let me sleep at night?
Look, you don't seem like a bad person, and I'm sorry you have to find out your mother's true colors like this.
But I'm not going to pity you. Everybody has their cross to bear.
Don't urge her to confide
You're right, I... I don't want this conversation to turn into an interrogation.
You've suffered enough already, I... I respect your silence.
Well, thank you...
Please excuse me.
Use a soft approach
I know your little game. You're no different from the rest of them.
You couldn't give a damn about me! The only thing you're interested in is finding out about your mother!
Don't say that. Not... not everyone wants to use you.
Some people care about you, don't they?
Mention her mother
Your mother, for example.
You mean the woman who left me in the hands of your mother?
The woman whose duty it was to give up her life to protect me?
I disowned my mother when I turned thirteen.
I... I'm sorry, I sh … I shouldn't have mentioned her.
Mention her father
Take your father. I'm sure he tried everything to save you.
Sure, he tried everything. To keep me from upsetting his political affairs.
Once I was declared insane, I was nothing but a burden that got in the way of his career.
By leaving me with your mother, he made all the horrors possible.
Mention her sister
Haven't you got a sister?
Yes...
I'm sure she loves you with all her heart.
She's the only one who cares about me.
I would have put an end to it all by now if it weren't for her.
Mention her brother
Don't you have a brother?
I have three but not one of them has bothered to help me!
Charles and Thomas were kept away from me to make sure I wouldn't upset them.
As for John, the only time he visited me was to make me swear to never publicly compromise his career.
Sorry, I... I didn't know.
You're an only son, right?
Does it show?
If you had a brother or sister, you'd know the way blood ties are unbreakable.
Except in my family, unfortunately.
Good Outcome
Since you insist, I'll tell you how I met your mother.
Thanks for trusting me.
You see, before I was born, my mother often suffered from hallucinations and fits of anger.
Soon, people could barely recognize her. She became a completely different person.
So my father spent an enormous amount of money paying for the best doctors. But none of them were able to cure her.
The last resort was to call a priest.
So, is that what your father did?
No.
He went to an expert in the occult.
Ah. My mother.
Her reputation already extended beyond our borders.
My mother's fits stopped at my birth, and Sarah de Richet concluded that the evil had passed into me.
Not only did it encourage her to stay but she took the opportunity to advise my father to... separate me from the rest of my family.
That's how I was declared stillborn. My fate was decided that very day.
It would coincide with my mother's frequent trips to America.
I had my first fit when I was three. That's when your mother began her... experiments. To rid me of the evil inside.
I understand how you feel but, I know my mother. I'm sure she had her reasons. Even if it seems difficult to believe.
Everything she put me through was all for nothing! My whole life was ruined for nothing.
So what brings you here, then?
My father used to know Sir Holm. He offered to introduce me to the world's leading authority in the occult.
Lord Mortimer.
He was my last hope. Until I found out he had also invited your mother.
It's got to be a coincidence. I don't believe for a second she's come here for you.
You can't change my mind about this, Louis, my days are numbered, and I know it.
Bad Outcome
I've got nothing more to say to you.
Figure it out yourself.
Excuse me... Monsieur de Richet?
I really need to talk to you.

Hm, Washington looks troubled.
Dear friends, I bid you welcome. I hope the night was not too short.
Your Eminence, Duchess, Monsieur de Richet, allow me to introduce our new guests, they arrived during the night.
Johann Christoph von Wöllner, Minister of Religious Affairs and close aide of Frederic William 2nd, King of Prussia.
Napoleon Bonaparte, lieutenant of the French Revolutionary Army.
And Jacques Péru, French Revolutionary Tribunal judge.
Unfortunately, my friends, Lord Mortimer will not be joining us this morning but he should be with us later. So let us begin!
What is Mortimer playing at? He tells me to come urgently, and he sends no one to meet me.
Observe Péru
Ha, Péru looks totally out of place here.
He's counting the ten sets of cutlery around each plate. The man is completely lost.
Response Timer End
Thank you again for the wine, Your Eminence.
It is served everyday at the King's table.
I am delighted to hear it.
Wöllner and Piaggi seem to be getting along well.
Analyse the conversation
Surprising when you know Wöllner prohibited religious practices in Prussia.
Renowned member of the Rose-Croix Order, former Freemason, and great lever of Alchemy.
... and look at Piaggi fawning over him. I really do have a problem digesting political protocol.
Response Timer End
My dear Johan, how are you?
Glad to make landfall at last. And yourself?
Very well.
And your husband?
He's poorly. The French Revolution gives him terrible headaches.
Oh, I understand... I shall feel better too as soon as the situation is settled.
If by chance the French crisis is emulated in Berlin, there will always be a refuge for you in London, my dear.
Your offer does you honor, Emily, but London is much closer to Paris than Berlin. Beware.
The French are capable of sailing up the Thames straight to the Houses of Parliament.
Oooh my friend, I am shaking in my clogs.
Think about the political situation in Europe
A Prussian-Britannic coalition is not good for France
The last time we fought against them our empire went up in smoke.
Response Timer End
Is the wine to your liking?
Very much so, Sir Gregory. Such complexity... typically French... a Sauternes, isn't it?
Absolutely.
If I'm not mistaken, this is not Lord Mortimer's favorite wine, it is yours.
In his absence, l have taken the liberty of making a slight deviation from the rule, but I count on your discretion.
Don't worry, I appreciate the same grape varieties as you.
I remember the last time we tasted that nectar here at this table... the finest minds of the century were present.
And the last time we drank it, the orphanage in Bloomsbury was still in ruins.
Would... would you repeat that?
Oh, well... I put some small effort into the works. The orphanage reopened just before Christmas.
The bedrooms, washrooms and the classrooms have all been refurbished.
I... I don't know what to say. You have given the girls a wonderful Christmas gift. Thank you …  
I made a promise. Now it is done.
Analyze Emily
It's the first time I've ever seen her so moved.
Just mentioning that orphanage broke right through Emily's hard shell.
Response Timer End
Is everything alright?
Yes, thank you. I had a moment of absence... but here I am again.
Ask Washington what he thinks of Wöllner
What do you think of Wöllner?
Many believe he is the real leader of Prussia. A charming man, but with an iron fist in a velvet glove.
I also know he is famous for his love of the hunt, in all its forms.
Ask Emily what she thinks of Wöllner
What do you think of Wöllner?
The Prussian King is his puppet.
I find it hard to believe, the King of Prussia so weak.
Be careful, Wöllner is as influential as he is dangerous.
You seem to know each other well.
We used to work together.
I see...
Get to know Wöllner
My Lord, I only know the prestige of your name. Might I have the honor of getting to know you a little better?
You are... Monsieur?
Louis Mauras De Richet.
De Richet... De Richet. A name with a nobiliary particle.
Are you descended from a noble line?
Neither nobleman nor commoner
I am just a simple French citizen.
Really? Oh, you seem nothing like a commoner, hahaha, especially compared to that wretch over there sharing our meal.
In spite of his particle, he is a commoner...
The presence of a particle does not necessarily mean a person belongs to the nobility.
Nor does it prevent the observance of the rules of etiquette, Monsieur... Von Wöllner
Deflect the question on himself
If you had helped me last night, I might have been willing to answer you. But that was not the case.
Louis, I haven't forgotten what happened last night. Leave me alone or I'll stick my fork in your hand.
Have you any information on this Napoleon?
Let Emily reply
What do you think, Madam? What is this Bonaparte doing here?
The presence of a soldier is never a good sign. It can only mean there's going to be further war.
To answer your question, I only know that his family were in favor of the Revolution, and that it almost cost them their lives.
Thank you that's helpful.
Let Emily reply
Maybe Emily has an idea?
Mortimer firmly believes in the young soldier.
He's going to finance a military campaign with the backing of the Golden Order.
It seems that Sarah gave it her blessing too.
I didn't know that!
Me neither.
I'll give Sarah a piece of my mind. I don't know what mess she's gotten herself into but for God's sake, she should have told us!
You knew everything. You could have answered for me.
That's true, but you have such a clever way with words.
Say that he doesn't matter
He's just a soldier, not even a high ranking one at that. I'll bet he's just here for some minor business.
I wouldn't be so categorical. No one is ever invited here just by chance. You'll see.
Share your information
Mortimer has arranged to keep his family out of the harmful reach of Corsican monarchists.
Hmm, interesting.
And that's not all. Mortimer and my mother have apparently agreed to deliver cannons to this Bonaparte.
What? Since when does the Order finance wars? Are you sure?
Unfortunately, yes. And the fact you didn't know my mother made this agreement makes it even stranger.
Thank you, Louis. At least you have taught me something.
Share your information
Lord Mortimer has invited Napoleon along to negotiate an important commercial venture.
Nothing strange about that.
And the Golden Order is somehow involved.
What? Our Order? Are you sure?
That's what I read in the letter from Mortimer to Napoleon.
Hmm... this information is important. Thank you, Louis.
Make an assumption
He's certainly well connected, and in high places.
Surprising. No one appears to know him.
No one knows me and yet here I am.
Quite so.
Hm, Washington looks troubled.

And that's not all. Mortimer and my mother have apparently agreed to deliver cannons to this Bonaparte.
What? Since when does the Order finance wars? Are you sure?
Unfortunately, yes. And the fact you didn't know my mother made this agreement makes it even stranger.
Thank you, Louis. At least you have taught me something.
Share your information
Lord Mortimer has invited Napoleon along to negotiate an important commercial venture.
Nothing strange about that.
And the Golden Order is somehow involved.
What? Our Order? Are you sure?
That's what I read in the letter from Mortimer to Napoleon.
Hmm... this information is important. Thank you, Louis.
Make an assumption
He's certainly well connected, and in high places.
Surprising. No one appears to know him.
No one knows me and yet here I am.
Quite so.
Monsieur De Richet?
It would seem we have common interests. Could we speak in private, please?
Speak of the devil!
Lord Mortimer and the Golden Order through your mother have concluded a financial agreement.
Stay composed, Louis.
I'm listening.
An agreement for cannons. Lord Mortimer assured me that you are to take over the project, on behalf of your mother.
You must know that I am deeply sorry about her disappearance, but I must validate the deal urgently, if I want to be able to organize things properly.
I haven't seen Lord Mortimer yet. I'm afraid I'll be unable to answer your questions.
He assured me that you could replace your mother during her absence.
I appreciate his confidence but still, this is a bit hasty. But please, continue...
Of course. But I need to know if I can count you among my allies.
Well, of course!
And for that, I have a little question for you.
The agreement stipulates an aid of 50 000 Louis d'or for 200 cannon.
Yes, we have an agreement
Absolutely! 50,000 Louis d'or in hard cash.
The offer I'm talking about was for only 20,000 Louis d'or, Monsieur de Richet. The truth is you really have no idea about our agreement.
So, you're wasting my time. I need to work with people I can have confidence in, sir.
The exact numbers may have escaped me. I suggest you wait for my mother's return in order to manage such details.
No, I cannot agree on such a deal
Surely such an amount will buy twice as many cannons!
Don't try to pull a fast one on me.  We're both young but we are not naive.
Please don't be offended. I just wanted to make sure you knew what you were talking about. And I am reassured!
I don't know
Errr... I don't know. Maybe you ought to speak to my mother.
Oh, what a pity! I was hoping you would be up to the challenge. Too bad.
It's not the right time
I've only just taken over the affair.
The agreement will be considered null and void until we've gone through it together. Is that clear?
Alright. You seem to know what you're doing.
I've heard a different number last night!
I have one last question I would like to pose to you.
We don't know each other yet, you and I. And I need to make sure that we both share the same vision for the future of France.
Given the hard times that have befallen our beautiful country, what do you think it would take to restore its luster?
It would need a counter-revolution!
The revolution was a good thing, but it gave birth to a monster. We must overthrow the new system in place.
Ah, you are right.
We should reinstate the monarchy
I don't know how to remedy the situation without re-establishing a solid monarchy.
And what would we stand to gain by this?
We've tried a Republic, but it is clear that with the situation we are in now that... it's not working. We ought to return to a monarchy!
That makes no sense at all, my friend!
The monarchy is a privileged cast who have forever built their prestige by crushing and controlling the people!
Let the people be free to choose
Let the people make their own choices..
You are joking, I hope! The people are simply not capable of taking charge, don't you see?
They are a uneducated mob who react on the spur of the moment, incapable of providing a coherent vision for the good of the country.
France needs a leader
I think what France is lacking today is a truly strong leader, ready to govern her.
Someone who will restore her luster. Who will propel her forward so once again she becomes a proud nation respected by all.
A man capable of both rebuilding the country from the inside, and at the same time developing exterior relations. Someone with a vision, I think.
The right person still remains to be found.
You're right, my friend, I hear your words, and I agree!
Let us trust the Convention.
It's time for Girondins and Montagnards to come together at last and give rise to a Republic worthy of all the spilled blood.
Both parties must put an end to their petty quarrels for the good of all.
You must be joking, my friend. Neither side will ever accept the advice of the other. It's simply a lost cause.
I know his motives...
Good Outcome
Monsieur de Richet, I am reassured. I am very happy to have met you.
Lord Mortimer was right to put his trust in you. I hope to work with you in the very near future.
I would like to thank you for your support by offering you this humble little gift.
"Reflections on the Revolution in France"
Monsieur Bonaparte, I thank you for this gesture, and please know that I, too, am delighted to have met you.
Bad Outcome
Hmm... I think there must be a misunderstanding.
What do you mean?
I cannot believe that Lord Mortimer advised me to speak to you. I must have misunderstood. Excuse me, please.
Bravo Louis, total fiasco...

Bravo Louis, total fiasco...
My friends, I would like to say a few words, please.
I would like to thank Lord Mortimer, and you, Sir Holm, for bringing us all together here.
Those of us for whom it is not the first time here, like me, are all trembling in sweet anticipation of the arrival of our host.
For the rest, I would like to reassure you that Lord Mortimer always has a few surprising projects to propose.
But I can assure you that each and every one of us has always benefited from them, heh,heh...
The last time I came to this place, Lord Mortimer offered to help me in my electoral campaign for the presidency of the United States.
And it is eminently clear that his support was an invaluable aid to us.
We are here among like-minded people. So let us put aside the conflicts in which some of our nations find themselves at present.
So I raise my glass in honor of you all, my new and old friends.
I trust you shall not be disappointed, Mr Washington.
Analyze Washington
Washington is a very gifted speaker.
Leave him for five minutes with sworn enemies and he'll convince them to be friends for life.
Right, we shall meet again tomorrow.
All the guests will be present, as well as Lord Mortimer, I hope.
Until then, I trust you will find plenty to keep you amused.

"Any earlier and I would have been caught."

Well done, Louis! The president of the United States asks for your assistance and you screw it up...
If mother finds out, I... I get the feeling I'll never hear the end of it. Not for a few years, anyway.
Now, what was I going to do last night?
Ah, yes. Search the room.
According to what I saw in my vision, this room was mother's before I got it.
Maybe she left something behind that will help me find her.

Here's something that will undermine my botanist's appreciation for the local climate.

Mother, you undoubtedly must have hidden a clue in this book.
Let's see if I can find anything else in this room...

The paper is rougher around the writing.
The paper is moist here. A very light stain, barely visible.
And the smell... reminds me of something.

I'm not far from solving the puzzle, I must keep searching.

Spread ashes on the book
Use the lemon
Hmm, that wasn't it. Not to mention I covered half the page with lemon juice, great!
Burnish the page with the candle stick
Step back
Damn, I'm making a serious mess here.
The message is illegible, I have to keep searching.
"Where all eyes size you up, you must pass by the Gorgon."
Gorgon was the name of Medusa in Greek mythology.
On the other hand, “Where all eyes size you up”? I don't get it.
And judging by the number of paintings in the manor, it could be anywhere.
After that she adds: "Beware Hero, the beast always charges the best protected soldier. And that's its weakness."
What is my mother trying to tell me?
Since you've gone to so much trouble, you must not have only found something important but...
You must have also felt like you were in great danger.
Damn! The message continues but thanks to me, the rest of the text is unreadable.
Great.
I hope it wasn't an unique edition or mother is gonna kill me.
Now, I'd better hurry and find that damn Medusa!
Sir, dinner is served in the red salon
Typical!
I'm not hungry. Please give my apologies to all the guests.
Err... Sir Holm requests your presence, Sir.
Well... I guess I'm just gonna have to wait before going and looking for my Medusa.
Tell him I'll be there in a minute.
Ink is always used to write a message, never to reveal one...
I must find something else...
It's no good... It might have worked if the writing had left marks in the paper …  but no, there's only traces of lemon.
Luckily I've only put ash on part of the message.
Louis, Louis... lemon is used to WRITE secret messages, not to reveal them.
I'll have to try something else...
Ah ha! It's working! The heat reveals the message!

Well, this bookcase is well stocked.
Oh, this book has been put back the wrong way around.
"A Voyage Around the World", the travel log of the explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville.
One of mother's favorite books. What a coincidence.
And I don't believe in coincidences. It's just too much.
I don't know what's going on here but if you felt threatened, I'll bet you'd leave a clue, wouldn't you mother?

Please, stop, you're scaring me! I'm a member of the tribunal, you shouldn't threaten me like that!
And I'm a member of the Golden Order. With all the contacts in the Paris press that implies.
One word from me and you'll be headline news. A full page dedicated to your little stay here.
So what? Wipe your ass with it!
Your revolutionary friends are sure to be delighted, reading about your new friendships with all these rich nobles on the island.

You bastard! I forbid you to blackmail me!
You're in no position to forbid me from anything, so you'd better remember what I said!
Turn around
Hmm, I'd rather keep all my teeth.

I found a rare edition of her favorite book.
She must have left something behind.
She applied a liquid to the book.
She must have used the writing materials.
The quill has been used but not with regular ink.
What if she used lemon juice instead! An old trick used to hide messages!
A message using invisible ink! I bet she used the lemon to leave a message!
Now, how do I reveal the message?
