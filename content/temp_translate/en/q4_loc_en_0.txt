Why the hell did I go with Elizabeth?
I could have spent the night with Emily, but no, I had to go play the knight with a big heart.
Ah well, never mind... Tomorrow's another day!

An unofficial Gospel. You'd be more likely to find this kind of book at the Vatican.
Nothing special. The library at Buckingham has three.
What a  bragger
Gee. Is there anything England doesn't have yet?
Wait, yes there is! The United States.
Well, not yet. Besides, as far as I know, they don't speak French in the United States.
Has she read them?
I bet you've read them cover to cover!
Naturally.
Really? I'm curious. Tell me, what part stood out the most to you?
The passage where Mary says to Joseph: Hey, you: shut up!
In other words, you haven't even opened one.
How did Buckingham get hold of them?
How did the English manage to get their hands on them?
When someone wants to attract the attention of the world's leading power, somehow the gifts just pour in.
You wouldn't have gone to the Vatican recently, would you?
Are you calling me a thief?
Certainly not. Never entered my mind!
Analyze the Gospel
The Gospel according to Judas or “How to crucify Jesus” as part of God's plan.
You do realize that the contents of this book could undermine the very foundations of Christianity?
One more reason to leave it in the secret room of a lost manor on a private island.
Do you realize how important this book is?
Of course, but what I really want to know is how did it come into Mortimer's possession?
I was thinking the same thing about all the paintings and sculptures in the manor.
Say nothing
I really need to talk to you, Louis. Right now !
Does Lord Mortimer know the mess you've made of your room?
Listen to me, damn it! My days are numbered.
Well, Elizabeth? What was... so... urgent?
For God's sake, what's happened in here?
I really need to talk to you, Louis. Right now !
Does Lord Mortimer know the mess you've made of your room?
Listen to me, damn it! My days are numbered.
Elizabeth, I don't know if it's about my mother again, but I'm telling you, you've nothing to be afraid of.
She didn't come here for you.
Alright, what have you got on your mind now?
You've got to listen to what I have to say while there's still time.
You need to know the truth about your mother.
About my mother? Wh... what do you mean?
I saw her!
Saw who? You saw my mother?! When?
Just last night!
I went out to walk along the clifftop and I saw her, in the distance.
She tried to hide right away, but I'm sure it was her!
Analyze her behavior
Are you saying you recognized my mother in the middle of the night, while she was hiding?
Yes, Louis, I know it was her.
You just said she was far away, right? In the middle of the night. And the exterior of the island isn't exactly well lit.
Listen! I'm telling you! It was her!
She doesn't hesitate on her answers, she's not trembling. She's really convinced of what she's seen.
Timer Answer
Did you talk to each other?
No, she was far away, I... I didn't make any noise and then she was gone.
Have you told anyone you've seen her? Sir Holm, Mortimer?
You don't understand. It's her... she's here …  
Yes, I understand.
No, you're not listening! The moment I saw her, I was overcome by spasms!
She's here! I'm telling you it was her!
Yes, I need something to calm me down.
Just one glass
I'll drink with you, but let's go easy on it, ok?
Refuse
No thanks. I... I'd better not.
Listen, if you want me to tell you everything, you have to drink with me, Louis!
What I have to say to you is of the utmost importance!
Refuse again
I don't know where she gets her rot-gut from, but frankly, it's disgusting.
You know, Louis, when I came here, it was in the hope of getting help.
I've only just now realized that I've been drawn here into a trap.
Woah... the alcohol's... going to my head.
Here, the condemned's last drink.
I'm right behind you
Man, I... I need to take it easy with the booze. At this rate, I won't last the night.
Let's go easy on the drinking, okay? Alcohol won't solve our problems.
I'll stop here
Elizabeth, alcohol never solves anything. I'm gonna stop now.
Listen up. You want to know what your mother was capable of, right?
You want to know the reason why! Well, you're gonna have to follow me to the bottom of the abyss, Louis!
Either drink, or get out!
No, really
Errrgh, the second one isn't any easier...
So? Do you want to know why she did all those things to me, or not?!
Even if it changes the image you have of her? Forever?
What was she trying to cure you of, then?
Of the one illness she never managed to treat me for.
Together till the end!
Come on Elizabeth! We have to finish what we started!
Stop, it's too much for me
No, Elizabeth! I won't follow you.
What's the matter? Little Louis's afraid to look at the true face of his mother?
You know my rules! Drink up!
No
No, I won't drink!
Alright, Louis! Then get the hell out of here!
You're incapable of opening your eyes! So be it!
GET OUT!
I feel all... dizzy …  
There must have been a reason! Just tell me! Tell me what my mother treated you for!
She wanted to silence them!!
Wh... What? What are you talking about? Silence what?
The voices.
The voices in my head. They speak to me, Louis.
They've always told me what to do. They say nasty things to me.
Is she possessed?
Elizabeth... are you saying that... that "spirits"... talk to you?
You're right, sometimes there are several voices. How did you know?
No, listen, I... I don't know anything. I... I'm just repeating what you said.
Is she stark raving mad?
Elizabeth... do you realize what you're saying?
Of course, Louis. This is what I live every day.
But these spirits, Elizabeth, don't exist. You do realize that.
These voices in your head, it's... it's you, in fact. Nobody is speaking to you.
They want me... want me just for themselves. They talk to me all the time.
Yet your mother did everything to make them go away. Ever since I was little. And look at the result!
It's impossible, Mother! You've spend your life trying to prove that the supernatural doesn't exist... why punish this poor girl?
Oh shit... what has she done to you?
Uh oh, Louis. Are you starting to believe me?
No but... she …  
Too bad it's all been for nothing.
They're still there, you know.
What do you mean? They're still talking to you?
All the time. Despite everything Sarah put me through, I still hear them.
And here I am on a lost island, knowing that no one knows me, and I find myself here at the exact same time as her.
You see? You understand? You sense it too. I'm going to die here.
I beg you... tell me you believe me …  
Yes, I believe her
I'm here, Elizabeth. I'm right here with you, and I do believe you.
Thank you, Louis. You know, despite what people might think, I'm not crazy.
No, keep logical!
Elizabeth, I understand your fears, but I'm convinced there has to be a rational explanation for all of this.
It would just hurt you too much to believe me, wouldn't it?
No, no... but …  
So difficult to get up in the morning and realize that you're the son of a monster.
I'd rather not have met you, I...
I'd rather not have been born.
My god, Elizabeth, how is this possible?
Welcome to my world, little Louis. Welcome to my life.
Fuck, I've drunk too much... I don't feel good at all …  
Well...
Advise her to escape from the island
Elizabeth, the whole story stinks of death.
If I were you, I'd have left the moment you heard me speak about my mother.
I don't know if she knows you're here, but if I had any doubt, I wouldn't take the risk.
Yeah, you're right.
I can't stay here another minute. I need to get the hell out of here.
I need to find a boat and get away. I'm not dying here.
Oh, I feel so dizzy...
Advise her to stay here
Let's not rush into things, you have nothing to fear here, I'm with you.
And anyway, my mother's gone missing. You're not in any danger.
That's not what the voices say.
Listen to me! Don't give up.
You must resist. And tomorrow, you'll see, things will be better.
You like my little concoction, don't you? That's rare.
What?
It no longer has any effect on me, but my guests generally don't appreciate me mixing alcohol with laudanum.
What? You... you put laudanum in my drink?
In both. Don't worry, my little Louis. We'll sink down to the bottom together.
Oh, bitch, you drugged me.
... Oh man, I feel like puking... I really feel like shit...  
I gotta... get back …  
Don't worry, Louis. I'm here now. I'll take good care of you.
And then, I'll leave.
What is this bitch gonna do to me?
Don't touch me!
If I get up, I'll fall.
... just leav …  
Oh, little Louis's tired... leave everything to me, just let go.
I really need to talk to you, Louis. Right now !
Does Lord Mortimer know the mess you've made of your room?
Listen to me, damn it! My days are numbered.
Well, Elizabeth? What was... so... urgent?

... just leav …  
Oh, little Louis's tired... leave everything to me, just let go.
Well, well, Louis, you took your sweet time...
What did our poor Elizabeth want?
Nothing important...
The truth is: I really don't have the slightest idea.
Probably talking about my mother
She probably wanted to chat more about my mother.
Really. So Miss Adams is somehow linked to your mother ?
In a way, I guess she is.
What is she doing here ?
The real question would be this: what exactly are you doing, Emily, in my room?
I've enjoyed our discussions very much and I had hoped that we could continue them.
But I thought all of that could wait until tomorrow?
That young girl seems very...
Emily? Have I misunderstood something here? What are you doing in my room?
And for a while now, a question has been nagging at me.
And that explains why I now find you here, in my bed?
Go ahead, ask me the question that's been burning at your lips.
I know your mother was here to meet someone but I can't figure out who.
Oh, so that's what's been hiding behind all this.
We are both members of the Order, Louis. Let's try to be honest with each other.
I have followed with great interest your affair in Paris, in connection with Mr. Von Borchert.
You managed to steal something from him, if I'm not mistaken.
The Book
Are you talking about the Book Of All Mysteries? Al Azif ?
That's right, Louis. A valuable bit of plunder, isn't it?
Yeah! When we finally found it, we took it.
And where is the book right now?
Amazingly, it's right here. Mother took it with her when she came.
It's possible...
Exactly.  And what about you, my friend?  What were you and your dear sister looking for here?
Well, our mission was to find out more about that particular book.
And why that one?
Let's just say that the Queen is desperately seeking a way of relieving the King from his difficulties... with dementia.
Well, how about that.
Why that ?
Emily, you suddenly seem to be very interested in my private affairs.
You aren't pumping me for information, are you?
Not in the least, Louis. I'm deeply hurt that you'd even think such a thing of me!
Look, I'm sorry, I... I just thought that …
Well, you thought wrong. I was interested in you, that's all. But that seems to be beyond you.
Don't... don't take it like that. Look, my mother and I recovered an old occult book that Von Borchert was planning to resell on the black market.
Okay? There, now you know it all.
This is quite fascinating.
But just what did Sarah expect to accomplish here?
Meet Von Borchert's buyer...
My mother came here to find out who Von Borchert planned on selling the Book to.
And did she find out?
I have no idea.
But I think she thought it would be someone invited to Mortimer's next party.
You mean, one of us here now?
That's what I think.
It wouldn't be you, by any chance?
Unfortunately no. I was planning to steal it myself.
Thank you for all this information, Louis.
Go figure...
If only I knew myself.
My mother always takes a sly pleasure in telling me as little as possible.
Oh, poor little Louis. Your mother hides things from you. That's not very nice.
No, it's not nice at all. And you? What were you supposed to do, once the Book was found?
Give it to our sponsor, of course. Sir Gregory has more than one card up his sleeve.
So you mean, Holm is playing both sides?
I'd say the Queen is going to be disapointed.
What can we do? Sometimes things work out like that.
She's trying to have me talk
It's fairly obvious that you're still trying to extract information from me, Emily.
Not at all, my friend. You obviously have a dark view of humanity.
One can't chat about anything without you seeing some evil plot.
Oho, don't get your panties all in a bunch. Okay, fine. My mother thought she might find the buyer of Von Borchert's book here.
I think she thought he'd be one of the people here on the island  right now.
Ah... I see.
Right, enough chatting. Come and join me instead.
Join her in the bed
I have to go, Louis. I don't want anyone finding me here in the morning.
You're right.  Well, have a good night.
Good night.  See you tomorrow, rested and ready!
Sure thing.
No thanks
Emily, don't take this wrong, but I really don't think this would be a good idea right now.
I see. You don't think it would do you some good to relax and clear your mind a bit?
That's a good point, but seriously? I'd rather we didn't.
I understand, Louis. I won't insist any further.
Thanks, Emily.
Good night. Pleasant dreams to you.
Good night.
Found her! There's my Gorgon. And she looks pretty worked up about something.
I've got to find out what mother was trying to do with her.
Found her! There's my Gorgon. And she looks pretty worked up about something.
I've got to find out what mother was trying to do with her.
What is that you found?
A Cameo pendant.
What's going on?
Nothing.
For crying out loud, Emily, you lunged for that jewel like your life depended on it!
Tell me what this is about!
No.
No.
I can't trust a man who sneaks into my room in the middle of the night.
Are you really gonna use that against me every time we meet?
It's difficult to pretend nothing happened.
We just met, Louis. I like you, but I can't just suddenly open myself up like a book to you.
Listen, Emily, it seems pretty obvious to me that you haven't come here for the sole purpose of sampling Mortimer's cellar.
Stop all the clever evasions and just trust me..
And why the hell should I place my trust in you, Louis?
Because you already did so once
You trusted me last night.
My being in your room was a bit odd, I'll give you that. And you might have taken me for a thief. Or worse.
But I managed to explain myself, right?
Look at us. I wonder what Mortimer would think if he found us here.
Let's trust each other, Emily. We are partners in crime now.
That, I grant you.
Because I trust you
Mortimer's letter, my mother's message in the book, the Golden Order, what more do you need as proof of my good will?
I freely admit that my wary side does get the better of me sometimes.
Wary? Yeah, like a wild animal!
Don't exaggerate.
But that's what I like about you.
Because I don't want any harm to come to you
When are you going to understand that I just want to help you?
What do you expect? That I'll fall into your arms and say "yes" to everything you want?
What are you talking about? I'm only asking you to trust me a little.
If only on principle, as a member of the Golden Order, for example.
Clean up your own back yard first!
Nothing! I have done absolutely nothing for you!
No to this, no to that. You ask for proof of trust, but when you get it, you turn a deaf ear.
You are defiant, evasive and paranoid. Go question your own motives, I've done all I can.
All right, fine! There's no point getting on your high horse, you know! So I'm wary, I grant you that.
Say nothing
At least this way, things are clear.
How do you expect me to open up to you at all if you can't even reassure me?
I'll admit, you are fairly reliable.
That's it? I was expecting more.
Well, I'm prepared to trust you when it comes to choosing a French cheese.
But I've nothing to gain by confiding in you any further than that.
Nothing to gain? Damn it, Emily, I'm only trying to help you. Stop needing to gain something all the time.
Because you think I need help?
Just like everyone. You have your strengths and your weaknesses. And there's no use pretending otherwise...
Hah, and I bet you've found out where I'm "weak", haven't you?
A weakness in Psychology
You think your scathing wit protects you but in fact, it makes you blind.
No sooner have people introduced themselves than you already see them in a bad light.
You play the part of the strong woman. And yes, you are a strong woman, of course, but what I see is a sensitive young lady, who lacks self-confidence.
Stop adopting a defensive posture and you'll see just how quickly new doors will open.
There is some truth to what you say.
A weakness in Questioning
It's obvious to me that whenever anyone seriously questions you, you start to lose your footing.
It's not a big deal in and of itself, but we can help each other when that happens.
Together we will be much stronger.
My dear Louis, you're very kind but you are completely mistaken.
I have no problem whatsoever dealing with being questioned.
I'm sorry to tell you but you read me badly.
A weakness in Occultism
Honestly, you don't seem to know all that much about the Occult.
I don't blame you, not everyone can have bathed in it since childhood.
But that's the point, you'd be doing yourself a favor if you trusted me. I'm sure I can be of more use to you than you think.
I am a highly skilled-member of the Order, and in the service of the Queen. Do you really believe I'm a novice when it comes to the Occult?
My dear Louis, sorry to be blunt, but you don't know what you're talking about.
A weakness in Subterfuges
Let's take your subterfuge talents, for example. You can't make me believe you'd be very effective at sneaking around unobserved, dressed as you are in that puffy, whalebone dress.
I do find your outfits ravishing, but couldn't you use someone like me to perform certain discreet tasks?
Louis, Louis, your naivety is almost touching. Since our arrival, I have been continuously exploring the island without anyone realizing.
Know that in a man's world, it is sometimes more efficient to wear a dress with a daring decolletage than to know how to pick a lock.
A weakness in Politics
Bribery, lies, double talk...
I find it hard to imagine you speaking the special language required when dealing in politics.
My friend, I belong to the English aristocracy. I am married to a duke. I regularly rub shoulders with the powerful of the Chamber of Lords.
And whenever Mortimer wants to have the ear of the Queen, I'm the one he turns to.
Remind me why you were called here?
Oh shit, I've screwed this up.
Analyze Emily's character
Pragmatic, intelligent, sure of herself.
Her only weak spot is her difficulty talking about herself.
I don't know much about your past, but I'm guessing you had to get by on your own, for much of your life.
It might have closed you off, and that can be a disadvantage.
It might be time for you to open up and risk a little trust... not every man you meet wants to hurt you.
Hmm... yes, you may be right.
I might have some weaknesses but I don't need your help to overcome them.
And I'm simply not contemplating collaborating with anyone at this time.
Do you understand?
She prefers to work alone
Yes. You're the kind of girl who gets by on her own and who shares nothing.
The fact is you are completely mistaken about me.
She likes to lead her investigations herself
Oh, it's crystal clear. You don't like people telling you what to do, and you do like giving the orders to everyone.
If I were the matron you speak of, I would have found an underling to search this place and I would be sound asleep in my bed.
She already has a partner
Yes, it's perfectly clear. You're already working with someone.
Ah, well spotted, Louis.
She takes orders from someone
Well, one thing is very clear: you're working for someone. You're the dark hand of someone more powerful.
Holm, for example. You seem to know each other very well.
Why are we bringing Holm to the conversation? If you knew me better, you would know that I take orders from no one.
Press her
I know you well enough to see that you're hiding something from me.
Why won't you look me in the eyes?
I've figured you out but you refuse to accept it. And you're starting to find me charming, too.
I admit it. You win. You, worst investigator there ever was, have "sussed" me out.
Hmm... well, at least you made me smile.
Reassure her about your short-lived collaboration
I don't see us as partners for life. You won't owe me anything, you know.
It doesn't commit you to anything, after all.
Alright, you've gone to a lot of trouble. You deserve an answer.
I already have a work partner.
I know my weaknesses, I don't doubt that your abilities will be of use to me...
... but I already have all that. Thanks to my teammate.
Is there any chance you might tell me who he is?
Mmm... no... I've already said too much.
Consider yourself lucky I've even given you this much. It's extremely rare, believe me.
Come on, don't stop now that you've come this far. You know that eventually I'll end up making you talk.
Well, since no one can resist you, let's see if you can guess who my partner is.
You're a gambler... So... your partner is...  
It's a man and it's...
Her father
Your father! The force of youth combined with the wisdom of ancestors...
I never knew my father.
And it'll be better for him if I never do find him.
Sorry.
I thought you'd figured out I was an orphan.
No... please forgive me, I... I didn't know.
Her old husband
Your husband, of course!
My husband? He can't even walk without a cane.
Poor old man. Let him live out the rest of his days in peace.
How nice for him...
A member of the Order
Chances are, you're working with a member of the Order.
The only members of the Order other than ourselves are your mother and Mr Washington. The former has sadly gone missing.
As for the latter, I knew nothing of his arrival. Incidentally, you must have noticed how inefficiently our Order communicates internationally.
Back
It's a woman and it's...
Her mother
Your partner must be your mother!
I would need to know who she is first.
Forgive me, I... I didn't know.
I'm an orphan, I thought you'd figured that out.
No I... I didn't know. Otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned it.
Now you know.
Her sister
Your sister. She's your partner! She's the one you're looking for!
Well, I am impressed. How the devil did you guess I had a sister. Virtually no one even knows.
My mother
It's as obvious as it is surprising, you're my mother's hard-hitting partner!
Oh God! Do you really believe the nonsense that comes out of your mouth?
Well, a second ago I did. A little...
Sorry, Louis, you mother is not my partner.
Back
Remember how she was affected by the cameo
Good Outcome
When it comes to getting results, you are very good, I grant you that.
You deserve to know why the sight of the cameo pendant affected me so strongly.
I thought it belonged to Emma, my twin sister.
Oh! Now I get why you said you had a memory for two.
Yes... you can't imagine to what extent, though. As children, everyone got us mixed up. So one day, we decided to play along.
Since then, we have become one and the same. We have officially erased the identity of my sister, Emma.
Emily Hillsborrow, the woman with two faces.
Clever. But isn't it complicated? How do you make it work?
One of us has no existence in the outside world. We share everything. First for one, then for the other.
We dress the same, wear the same make-up, we speak the same. We've learned to act as one.
When we accept a mission, we both turn up. This time, though, she went ahead and I was meant to wait for her on the mainland.
She was meant to meet Sir Holm and bring back the details so we could work out who would follow-up.
And there was a problem?
She was supposed to return from Mortimer's one week ago.
The boat turned up at Plymouth but, alas, no trace of my sister.
Instead, a sailor passed me a message from Holm notifying me of her sudden disappearance.
So... my mother and your sister go missing just a few days apart... that's strange.
Maybe their disappearances are linked.
It's clearly a possibility, but up to now I haven't found a trace of either of them.
None of this is very reassuring.
By the way, Louis, now that you are in on the secret, you are obliged to keep it to yourself, or you will pay very dearly.
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.
Bad Outcome
Right, time is short.
You haven't convinced me. I prefer to remain discreet, don't take it the wrong way.
All I can tell you is I'm looking for my sister.
And if I reacted so strongly at the sight of the cameo pendant, it's because I thought it belonged to her. But it doesn't.
I understand... I won't insist.
It's time to leave.
What is that you found?
A Cameo pendant.
What's going on?
Nothing.
For crying out loud, Emily, you lunged for that jewel like your life depended on it!
Tell me what this is about!
No.
No.
I can't trust a man who sneaks into my room in the middle of the night.
Are you really gonna use that against me every time we meet?
It's difficult to pretend nothing happened.
We just met, Louis. I like you, but I can't just suddenly open myself up like a book to you.
Listen, Emily, it seems pretty obvious to me that you haven't come here for the sole purpose of sampling Mortimer's cellar.
Stop all the clever evasions and just trust me..
And why the hell should I place my trust in you, Louis?
Because you already did so once
You trusted me last night.
My being in your room was a bit odd, I'll give you that. And you might have taken me for a thief. Or worse.
But I managed to explain myself, right?
Look at us. I wonder what Mortimer would think if he found us here.
Let's trust each other, Emily. We are partners in crime now.
That, I grant you.
Because I trust you
Mortimer's letter, my mother's message in the book, the Golden Order, what more do you need as proof of my good will?
I freely admit that my wary side does get the better of me sometimes.
Wary? Yeah, like a wild animal!
Don't exaggerate.
But that's what I like about you.
Because I don't want any harm to come to you
When are you going to understand that I just want to help you?
What do you expect? That I'll fall into your arms and say "yes" to everything you want?
What are you talking about? I'm only asking you to trust me a little.
If only on principle, as a member of the Golden Order, for example.
Clean up your own back yard first!
Nothing! I have done absolutely nothing for you!
No to this, no to that. You ask for proof of trust, but when you get it, you turn a deaf ear.
You are defiant, evasive and paranoid. Go question your own motives, I've done all I can.
All right, fine! There's no point getting on your high horse, you know! So I'm wary, I grant you that.
Say nothing
At least this way, things are clear.
How do you expect me to open up to you at all if you can't even reassure me?
I'll admit, you are fairly reliable.
That's it? I was expecting more.
Well, I'm prepared to trust you when it comes to choosing a French cheese.
But I've nothing to gain by confiding in you any further than that.
Nothing to gain? Damn it, Emily, I'm only trying to help you. Stop needing to gain something all the time.
Because you think I need help?
Just like everyone. You have your strengths and your weaknesses. And there's no use pretending otherwise...
Hah, and I bet you've found out where I'm "weak", haven't you?
A weakness in Psychology
You think your scathing wit protects you but in fact, it makes you blind.
No sooner have people introduced themselves than you already see them in a bad light.
You play the part of the strong woman. And yes, you are a strong woman, of course, but what I see is a sensitive young lady, who lacks self-confidence.
Stop adopting a defensive posture and you'll see just how quickly new doors will open.
There is some truth to what you say.
A weakness in Questioning
It's obvious to me that whenever anyone seriously questions you, you start to lose your footing.
It's not a big deal in and of itself, but we can help each other when that happens.
Together we will be much stronger.
My dear Louis, you're very kind but you are completely mistaken.
I have no problem whatsoever dealing with being questioned.
I'm sorry to tell you but you read me badly.
A weakness in Occultism
Honestly, you don't seem to know all that much about the Occult.
I don't blame you, not everyone can have bathed in it since childhood.
But that's the point, you'd be doing yourself a favor if you trusted me. I'm sure I can be of more use to you than you think.
I am a highly skilled-member of the Order, and in the service of the Queen. Do you really believe I'm a novice when it comes to the Occult?
My dear Louis, sorry to be blunt, but you don't know what you're talking about.
A weakness in Subterfuges
Let's take your subterfuge talents, for example. You can't make me believe you'd be very effective at sneaking around unobserved, dressed as you are in that puffy, whalebone dress.
I do find your outfits ravishing, but couldn't you use someone like me to perform certain discreet tasks?
Louis, Louis, your naivety is almost touching. Since our arrival, I have been continuously exploring the island without anyone realizing.
Know that in a man's world, it is sometimes more efficient to wear a dress with a daring decolletage than to know how to pick a lock.
A weakness in Politics
Bribery, lies, double talk...
I find it hard to imagine you speaking the special language required when dealing in politics.
My friend, I belong to the English aristocracy. I am married to a duke. I regularly rub shoulders with the powerful of the Chamber of Lords.
And whenever Mortimer wants to have the ear of the Queen, I'm the one he turns to.
Remind me why you were called here?
Oh shit, I've screwed this up.
Analyze Emily's character
Pragmatic, intelligent, sure of herself.
Her only weak spot is her difficulty talking about herself.
I don't know much about your past, but I'm guessing you had to get by on your own, for much of your life.
It might have closed you off, and that can be a disadvantage.
It might be time for you to open up and risk a little trust... not every man you meet wants to hurt you.
Hmm... yes, you may be right.
I might have some weaknesses but I don't need your help to overcome them.
And I'm simply not contemplating collaborating with anyone at this time.
Do you understand?
She prefers to work alone
Yes. You're the kind of girl who gets by on her own and who shares nothing.
The fact is you are completely mistaken about me.
She likes to lead her investigations herself
Oh, it's crystal clear. You don't like people telling you what to do, and you do like giving the orders to everyone.
If I were the matron you speak of, I would have found an underling to search this place and I would be sound asleep in my bed.
She already has a partner
Yes, it's perfectly clear. You're already working with someone.
Ah, well spotted, Louis.
She takes orders from someone
Well, one thing is very clear: you're working for someone. You're the dark hand of someone more powerful.
Holm, for example. You seem to know each other very well.
Why are we bringing Holm to the conversation? If you knew me better, you would know that I take orders from no one.
Press her
I know you well enough to see that you're hiding something from me.
Why won't you look me in the eyes?
I've figured you out but you refuse to accept it. And you're starting to find me charming, too.
I admit it. You win. You, worst investigator there ever was, have "sussed" me out.
Hmm... well, at least you made me smile.
Reassure her about your short-lived collaboration
I don't see us as partners for life. You won't owe me anything, you know.
It doesn't commit you to anything, after all.
Alright, you've gone to a lot of trouble. You deserve an answer.
I already have a work partner.
I know my weaknesses, I don't doubt that your abilities will be of use to me...
... but I already have all that. Thanks to my teammate.
Is there any chance you might tell me who he is?
Mmm... no... I've already said too much.
Consider yourself lucky I've even given you this much. It's extremely rare, believe me.
Come on, don't stop now that you've come this far. You know that eventually I'll end up making you talk.
Well, since no one can resist you, let's see if you can guess who my partner is.

No... please forgive me, I... I didn't know.
Her old husband
Your husband, of course!
My husband? He can't even walk without a cane.
Poor old man. Let him live out the rest of his days in peace.
How nice for him...
A member of the Order
Chances are, you're working with a member of the Order.
The only members of the Order other than ourselves are your mother and Mr Washington. The former has sadly gone missing.
As for the latter, I knew nothing of his arrival. Incidentally, you must have noticed how inefficiently our Order communicates internationally.

I understand... I won't insist.
It's time to leave.
Oh, my head... I shouldn't have drunk so much.
Elizabeth, I... I need you to tell me what we've been drinking …  
Oh fuck... Elizabeth!
Mademoiselle? May I come in?
One moment!
Oh shit!
Oh, my head... I shouldn't have drunk so much.
Elizabeth, I... I need you to tell me what we've been drinking …  
Oh fuck... Elizabeth!
Mademoiselle? May I come in?
One moment!
Oh shit!
Monsieur de Richet, I am arresting you for the murder of Elizabeth Adams.
I beg your pardon? What are you talking about, I mean, I just saw her last night.
Which makes you our prime suspect.
What the hell's going on?
The attendants are going to escort you out of the room. I advise you not to put up any resistance.
Alright, alright, I'm coming with you!
You are in deep trouble, my young friend!
Monsieur de Richet? At last we meet.
Lord Mortimer?
I do apologize for being late, I was obliged to clear up some... urgent business.
I know you're concerned about your mother. But before we can talk about that, I need to inform you that... Miss Adams has been found in her room.
Is she feeling better?
You weren't made aware?
I'm afraid Elizabeth Adams died during the night.
No, no
Nothing of interest...
Did you find anything, Louis?
Not so far.
Maybe this paper...
No.
It's a real museum here...
Are you enjoying the visit?
A golden fleece...
It's freezing, hurry up.
Advise her to use the hide
Cold? You want a rug? It'll warm you up.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that horrible thing.
That's a pity, the gold color brings out your eyes
And your flattery brings out your boorishness.
Do you think it's the Golden Fleece?
Do you think that can really be Jason's golden fleece?
No. You are aware that Jason and the Argonauts is a myth, aren't you?
But Mortimer's been protecting this hide. It must of great value, don't you think?
Certainly of historical value. This kind of hide is still used by gold diggers in Eastern Europe.
Now you see how easy it is to obtain a legend.
Why do you have to act so nonchalant every time I show you something?
Louis, anyone can kill a sheep, rip off its hide and say it's the Golden Fleece.
We're at Lord Mortimer's', not at some farmyard fair. You're just too skeptical
And you have a tendency to believe anything. Talk about an unlikely pair!
Yet, you know opposites attract, don't you?.
Say nothing
"Where all eyes size you up"...
Chances are, that's the room my mother spoke of!
And she also spoke of a Medusa. Should I go and try to find the creature now?
"Where all eyes size you up"...
Chances are, that's the room my mother spoke of!
And she also spoke of a Medusa. Should I go and try to find the creature now?
I've resolved the enigma of the Medusa
I've found out that Emily was hiding something
I persuaded Emily to tell me her secret
I didn't persuade Emily to tell me her secret
I could have spent the night with Emily
I had a few drinks with Elizabeth
I left Elizabeth's place before I got drunk
I spent the night with Emily
I could have found out more about the past of Elizabeth and my mother
I could have joined Emily in my room
I discovered Lord Mortimer's room where he hides his treasure
I accepted to keep Elizabeth company
I preferred to join Emily in my room
The only person sizing me up here, is that monumental Zeus.
It can't be here...
The only person sizing me up here, is that monumental Zeus.
It can't be here...
If I respect the legend, I have to place the hero holding the shield in front of the Medusa.
Except for here, it doesn't work, there must be something else.

Alright, let's recap... before dinner, I was going to investigate my mother's message.
I've got to find the place: "Where all eyes size you up."
Alright, let's recap... before dinner, I was going to investigate my mother's message.
I've got to find the place: "Where all eyes size you up."
Open the Jar
Emily? What if I open the jar? Would that then make men responsible for all the evils?
Try! It'll make a change.
Alright, can we move on now?
I do love your irony but honestly, are you ever impressed by anything you see?
By a chamber pot? No, you'll need to do better than that!
Open the Jar
Right... we'll soon see. If it really is the original Pandora's box, I guess we'll be in store for some misery sooner or later.
Don't open the Jar
Actually, I'd rather not open it.
You're afraid, aren't you?
Have you ever heard of the Ark of the Covenant?
Yes.
A piece of advice: if you come across it: don't open it, you'll thank me.
Read the inscription
Ancient Greek. Translated, it reads: “The all-gifted.'
Could this jar be the original Pandora's box?
Emily, I've found Pandora's box! It's not as impressive as I thought it would be. But that's how these things usually go.
I detest that legend. Once again, women are made responsible for all of the world's evils.
And stop playing with that pot, you'll break it. Come on, let's move on.
Examine the symbols
The heavenly symbols refer to Pandora's box.
Emily! I'm pretty sure I've got Pandora's box!
Of course, you have. You see an earthen pot and you immediately assume it can only be Pandora's box. Logical!
What I like about you, Louis, is that you never fail to surprise me.
Leave
Carry on searching!
Guess what I've found.
The Holy Grail!
Older than that.
A piece of Noah's Arc?
Not that old.
This could go on for hours, just tell me!
Caesar's laurel wreath,
Try on the crown
Stop! Don't put your grubby fat fingers on it!
You find my fingers fat?
Hahaha... at least put on some gloves.
Please note: my fingers are slim.
You were going to leave marks! My god, what an amateur!
Many harpsichord players would love to have sexy fingers like mine.
Tell me where you took your infiltration classes so I can have your tutor executed.
Let's compare hands then. We'll soon see whose fingers are fattest.
No, I'm not going to compare hands with you. Let's just keep going.
Bad loser!
Why Laurels as a symbol?
Do you know why laurel wreath are used? And not say... mistletoe or... another plant?
The laurel wreath symbolized glory in roman times.
In your opinion, what kind would suit me best?
A crown of nettles.
Mortimer thinks he's Caesar
I can just see Mortimer dressed in a toga, wearing a laurel wreath. Strutting around his manor all day long.
You have a curious idea of Mortimer.
Why? He's eccentric, like all the English are, isn't he?
Well, if Peru stands for French grace, then if I were you, I wouldn't be making that sort of remark.
Identify the object
The workmanship on this crown is amazing.
The finesse of the gold laurel leaves is beautiful.
A crown worthy of an emperor
I'd stake my life that it's the genuine article.

So? What do you think of our first adventure?
I must admit it has been fun by your side.
Same here.
If we'd solved the mechanism of the Medusa together, the story would have been perfect.
As Emily turned the Shield toward the dreaded Medusa, Louis rotated the knight with the sword.
A creak later, the secret door of the chimney opened.
A slight twist on what really happened won't harm future stories about our adventures.
Ooh, she's been drinking too much again.
Louis, I need to talk to you right now!
Good evening, Elizabeth.
Actually, this is not a good time...
I'm beging you, please, don't leave me alone!
I'll be waiting for you in your room but don't be late.
I was sure there was a certain je-ne-sais-quoi between us!
Louis, we need to talk now, otherwise it'll be too late!
Looks like Elizabeth really needs me, but if I start talking to her, for sure Emily won't wait for me.
What should I do?
Follow Elizabeth
Sorry, Emily, but I can't leave Elizabeth like this.
Alright, Elizabeth, how can I help?
Thank you, come on, follow me.
Join Emily
Excuse me, Elizabeth, but some very urgent business has cropped up.
We can speak tomorrow.
No, Louis! Don't leave me alone! They've come back!
Goodnight, Madam.

I've set something off...
Woah!
I hope the real Medusa isn't waiting for me on the other side.
Raahhh! For Pete's sake, Emily! You scared the pants off me! Don't ever do that again!
Mh, keep your nose out of my business then.
I don't know what you're talking about.
First my room, now here!
Stop following me, you're becoming a nuisance.
Wait a minute, are you... you're not implying that I'm here to court you? Are you?
Oh Louis, I'm just stating the obvious.
You wouldn't be the first, rest assured.
Yeah, this is embarrassing! The worse thing is that it seems to be working.
Stop fooling around, and tell me what you're doing here.
Answer her frankly
I've discovered a hidden message from my mother.
She explains how to find the secret room.
Something must have attracted her here so... I've come to check it out.
And you? What brings you here?
My, you're curious.
Let me guess.
Go on then, impress me.
I imagine she is looking for someone too.
You're looking for somebody.
Your silence speaks volumes! I must have got it right.
And you will go to great lengths to find them. So, this person means a lot to you.
She has to investigate Mortimer
You're spying on Mortimer, right?
Everyone is spying on Mortimer.
Shall I take that for a "yes"?
Take it as you please but I wouldn't be surprised if all the guests were around here somewhere searching the manor.
Whatever, make a joke
You're trying to find where Mortimer hides his tasty vintage wines, right?
We are not amused.
Ah!! So that's what I must have bumped into on my way in!
What are you talking about?
Your sense of humor. It was looking for the exit.
If you value your physical welfare, it would be a good idea not to abuse yours.
Hah! You've just found it again!
Dodge the question with humor
I was feeling a bit peckish. I went in search of the kitchen and I ended up here.
Your sense of direction is mind boggling, isn't it?
Answer with a question
Oh yeah? So tell me what you're doing here.
I'm just … I mean... I...  
Yeah... just like me.
Probably, but I asked the question first.
Well then, we'll pretend you haven't asked me yet.
What about a little gallantry, Louis? Come on, I'm listening. What are you doing here?
Say nothing
Uh, I thought you'd have a bit more wit, sir. I am disappointed.
Make a joke
I admit everything, Madame. You win... I've been bitten by the same bug as you.
I beg your pardon?
We can't resist being where we shouldn't, seeking out our host's little secrets. So we have that in common, right?
I really thought you were going to answer me this time.
Ladies first.
Since you insist, Duchess, gallantry obliges this: ladies first!
You just won't give in, will you!
I'm sorry, Madam, it isn't in my nature.
Stop this little game for a moment.
Listen, this isn't one of Madam Scudery's soirees. There's no room for courtesy in a place like this.
I promise in any other circumstances, I would try to show a bit more spirit in my efforts to amuse you.
For today, I suggest we focus on the rather obvious fact that we are both interested in spying on our host.
I congratulate you on your knowledge of fashionable soirees of the XIIth century, but you have just ruined the ambiance, Louis.
Well, no matter. I'll tolerate your presence, this one time.
Now since you're here, make yourself useful.
Look around on your side, I'll do the same on mine, and If you find anything of interest, let me know!
Yeah, in your dreams...
At your service, Madam!
I've set something off...
Woah!
I hope the real Medusa isn't waiting for me on the other side.
Raahhh! For Pete's sake, Emily! You scared the pants off me! Don't ever do that again!
Mh, keep your nose out of my business then.
I don't know what you're talking about.
First my room, now here!
Stop following me, you're becoming a nuisance.
Wait a minute, are you... you're not implying that I'm here to court you? Are you?
Oh Louis, I'm just stating the obvious.
You wouldn't be the first, rest assured.
Yeah, this is embarrassing! The worse thing is that it seems to be working.
Stop fooling around, and tell me what you're doing here.
Answer her frankly
I've discovered a hidden message from my mother.
She explains how to find the secret room.
Something must have attracted her here so... I've come to check it out.
And you? What brings you here?
My, you're curious.
Let me guess.
Go on then, impress me.
I imagine she is looking for someone too.
You're looking for somebody.
Your silence speaks volumes! I must have got it right.
And you will go to great lengths to find them. So, this person means a lot to you.
She has to investigate Mortimer
You're spying on Mortimer, right?
Everyone is spying on Mortimer.
Shall I take that for a "yes"?
Take it as you please but I wouldn't be surprised if all the guests were around here somewhere searching the manor.
Whatever, make a joke
You're trying to find where Mortimer hides his tasty vintage wines, right?
We are not amused.
Ah!! So that's what I must have bumped into on my way in!
What are you talking about?
Your sense of humor. It was looking for the exit.
If you value your physical welfare, it would be a good idea not to abuse yours.
Hah! You've just found it again!
Dodge the question with humor
I was feeling a bit peckish. I went in search of the kitchen and I ended up here.
Your sense of direction is mind boggling, isn't it?
Answer with a question
Oh yeah? So tell me what you're doing here.
I'm just … I mean... I...  
Yeah... just like me.
Probably, but I asked the question first.
Well then, we'll pretend you haven't asked me yet.
What about a little gallantry, Louis? Come on, I'm listening. What are you doing here?
Say nothing

“The origin of myths”. A reinterpretation of legendary creatures.
Just what I need.
The text is in French on the left-hand page and in Latin on the right-hand.
Let's find the chapter on the Medusa.
Read the page in French
Hang on, this version is significantly different from the regular one.
It recounts how men have always belittled women in society.
Harpies, mermaids, the chimera, the Hydra, the Gorgons.
Ah, the section on the Medusa!
"While some of the heroes divert attention from the Gorgon, the hero with the sword brandishes his weapon at the Medusa."
Read the page in Latin
There's an extra line in the Latin translation.
"The night light was reflected in the shield and blinded the monster. So the hero with the sword seized the opportunity and cut off its head."

Well, Your Eminence, do you still have any room left?
Ah, my son, the sin of gluttony is the most difficult of all, in my eyes.
Nevertheless, what a charming moment we have had together.
I'm delighted I was able to talk to Mr. Von Wöllner. We hadn't spoken to each other for an eternity.
Yes, I noticed that Your Eminence knew a fair number of people at the table.
The benefit of age, my son. This isn't my first invitation to Lord Mortimer's.
You'll see, it's the perfect place to make new friends. Indeed, I noticed that you and Mr Bonaparte have already begun.
Ah, I adapt quickly to local customs, it's what I was taught.
And you are right to do so, my son.
But tell me, have you had any news of your mother since your arrival?
Alas, still nothing, Your Eminence. But I still haven't been able to meet Lord Mortimer.
Do not worry. It is typical of him, what can I say? Lord Mortimer is a very busy man.
I should think you are beginning to worry.
No, not really.
To tell you the truth, not really.
You are right. Be positive!
Perhaps Sarah is in the company of Lord Mortimer and they both will turn up shortly.
Probably
Well, I must admit, Your Eminence, indeed it does worry me.
I understand, Louis. But continue to have faith in Sarah.
You'll see, I'm sure that in a few days we'll all be laughing together.
That's all I hope for, Your Eminence.
But while I have you with me, I... I have a question for you.
Go ahead, Louis. What can I do for you?
Where all eyes size you up, does that mean anything to you?
If I said to you "where all eyes size you up,”... would it mean anything to you?
Oh, I don't know if it's the place you're looking for, Louis, but it makes me think of the Portrait Gallery.
There's a Gallery here? Can you tell me where to find it, please?
Of course. Just go through the door at the end. It will lead into the library. Continue all the way through and you'll end up in the gallery.
You'll see it, Louis. When you get there, you'll know.
Thank you very much, Your Eminence.
I'm looking for a medusa.
As I haven't visited all the manor yet, I wondered if you hadn't seen a medusa by any chance?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, la... la Gorgone, the Medusa from Greek mythology. Would you have seen one? In any shape or form.
Not at all, my son. I'm not sure what you're getting at, but unfortunately I am not going to be of any use to you.
Thank you anyway, Your Eminence, I won't take up any more of your time.
Take your leave
On that last word, then I shall leave you to fight your demons.
See you later, Your Eminence.
See you later, my son.
Here's something interesting.
A manor in Maine, hundreds of acres of land in Catalonia, properties in Shanghai...
Incredible, some of these deeds are over six hundred years old. And all signed by the hand of Mortimer.
I wonder if that's what inspired my mother's attention.
How come all these documents have Mortimer's signature on them?
Do you think all these properties really belong to him?
Assume a theft
Probably, but that doesn't mean they weren't stolen.
But Mortimer's signature? It looks genuine.
Maybe he erased the original ones and signed his name instead.
Assume a falsification
These documents must be fakes. No man can own that many original works, no matter how rich he is.
Be careful. The Order has tried many times to estimate his personal wealth without ever succeeding.
And look here! Castles in Scotland, vineyards in Italy, districts in Venice! He's richer than some European countries!
Assume there are several Mortimers
Several people have played the part of Mortimer. A part that has been passed down from generation to generation.
Different men, but with one sole identity.
An intriguing hypothesis... and yet less twisted than some of my previous cases.
At last, you finally agree with me about something!
Assume Mortimer is immortal
Maybe Mortimer is immortal or capable of living for a very long time, like Methuzelah.
A first smile. Careful! Keep that up and soon you'll end up laughing!
Carry on spouting inanities like that and indeed, I might.
Analyze the documents
See those fine scratches around the words?
Yes, and?
The ink barely spreads on the paper. It spreads exactly the same way on the signature.
The deed was written using the same ink. If it is a fake, then it's a professional job.
Analyze the documents
These documents are intriguing but do you really think that's what attracted your mother's attention here?
And how do you know my mother was interested in this room?
I didn't know, I just supposed she was. And you just confirmed it. So? Do you think she found what she came for?
I don't know. She was obsessed with Mortimer and I must confess these property deeds are troubling.
If that's the case, why would she have left them?
Once again, I don't know. We'll have to ask her when we find her. And what's your take?
What do you think of this collection?
Mortimer's collection is unique, isn't it?
That's an understatement. No doubt he has a major passion for history and fine art. Or getting gifts.
If each time Mortimer does someone a favor, they reward him with a priceless gift,
... that means he must have helped nearly everybody in the world.
Why conceal these assets?
Why keep such a collection hidden in a secret room. Any thoughts?
Mortimer has every reason in the world to conceal it. Even if only to keep it from people like us.
Hey, Emily, we're not thieves. We're only looking.
How has it all been acquired?
How did Lord Mortimer get all this? It's just crazy!
Secret connections, money, or a well-kept family treasure passed on from generation to generation.
Who knows...
That would mean some of Mortimer's ancestors lived before Jesus was born.
I wonder why my mother didn't make it clear what she was interested in here.
She didn't have time to write it down or maybe she wasn't sure of what she was looking for.
Or she wanted to protect her discoveries... it's disturbing.
You'll just have to search the rest of the room. Maybe you'll find something.

I've found an amazing ring.
There's an inscription engraved on it.
Ask Emily about her marriage
You are married. Why don't you wear a wedding ring?
You mean wear something just to prove your love? Not my style.
Pretend to propose with the ring
Emily, when I see that ring, I can no longer hold back my feelings for you.
Oh, stop it, you're being ridiculous.
What d'you mean? I was just about to get down on one knee.
Translate the inscription
The mythical Ring of the Nibelung.
Louis, do you really believe it's the ring of the legend?
You should try it on. They say if you wear it on your finger, it makes you more agreeable.
How drole! In the legend it's a cursed ring.
Say nothing
The spear that pierced Christ.
Of Course. Only the Holy Grail's missing...

The Medusa...
A hero armed with a sword...
Hmm... A hero with a lantern.
And the last one holding a shield.
I'll stake my life on it: all the statues form a single scene together. The poor devils are about to face the beast.
Let's give them a helping hand.
The Medusa...

Hmm... A hero with a lantern.
And the last one holding a shield.
I'll stake my life on it: all the statues form a single scene together. The poor devils are about to face the beast.
Let's give them a helping hand.
Think about the configuration
Now Louis, it's time to keep a logical mind, as every good scientist should.
The aim is to defeat the Medusa, so what can the lantern be for?
To light up the Medusa? Hardly likely. The hero holding the lantern will be easy prey and the shield will be of no use.
To light up the sword? No, that makes no sense. So that leaves the shield...
Mmm... I wonder if the aim is to play with the light. If I turned the shield right, the light would be reflected.
The ray of light will perturb the Medusa and focus her attention on the best protected hero.
Pretty smart.
But it also means I'll have to make sure I get the shield positioned just right.
Consider the value of the Lantern
When I see the lantern and the shield, I can't help thinking back to my childhood.
Mr Dorffer, our teacher, I used to drive him insane.
As soon as the sun came out, I got a kick out of distracting him with the inkwell, by deflecting the light with it.
I'd turn it in such a way as to direct a spot of light onto his face. Not strong enough to dazzle him but just enough to annoy him.
Hey, what if I tried to annoy the Medusa with the lamp on the shield? Position it just right and it might work.
Think about the configuration
Rotate the statuette

I know this legend
In Greek mythology, anyone who looked into the eyes of the Medusa turned to stone.
So the monster's statue must be turned toward someone who can protect their eyes.
It can only be the hero holding the shield.
Remember de Richet's message
The clue I found said: “Beware Hero, the beast always charges the best protected. That is its weakness.”
That's the key. The best protected hero is the one holding the shield.
Thank you, Mother!

Handle the mechanism
Hmm, the mechanism is worn here.
Whenever the shield is not turned toward the sword, the machinery freezes up. The statue must have been in this position most of the time.
Betrayed by the marks of time. So that makes it easy. The shield must face the sword.
Consider the optics
Let's think: to vanquish the beast, the statues have to be lined up in a specific order.
What can this shield be for? To protect its holder?
Why not? But in that case, what's the lantern for?
Step back and take a second, Louis... be logical, but open minded. Think outside the box.
Nobody said a statue has to have only one use. I wonder if the lantern was to distract the Medusa.
The shield can both protect the holder, and also reflect the light from the lantern to distract the beast.
In other words, I'll have to make an angle of ninety degrees between the lantern and the Medusa by turning the shield to face the sword.
If Mortimer's the one who thought of all this stuff then, honestly, he must have a screw loose. Crazy idea... but worth a shot!

You should see this sword, Emily, it's magnificent.

Sword of Joan of Arc
It really does look like Joan of Arc's sword.
The famous Maid of Orleans. One of your favorite historical heroines.
You bet! Given the number of English butts she kicked!
And we all know where that got her.
Sword of King Arthur
I think this is Excalibur, King Arthur's sword. I've always dreamed of drawing it from the stone.
How sweet, you're still clinging to your boyhood dreams.
Sword of Genghis Khan
I think it's the sword of Genghis Khan.
Brush up on your classics. Asian weapons are definitely not this shape.
All the swords forged in Asia don't necessarily have a curved blade.
Are you blind? It's a thrusting saber. A pure product of the west.
When you don't get the last word, your repartee goes all aggressive.
Pss...
Assess the weapon
This weapon is typically French, quite old, undoubtedly goes back to the crusades.
If it is a true damask sword it's worth more than a kingdom.
Assess the date
Brass quillons and knobs... a beautiful cruciform line.
Judging by the wear and the technique used to forge it, this sword dates back to the Crusades. And it must have belonged to a wealthy knight.
There's a date: MCXC. Eleven hundred ninety... that's right, forged for the Crusades.
