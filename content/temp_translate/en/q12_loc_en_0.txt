Come closer, Louis.
Come, we have to talk.
No need to be afraid.
There's nothing to worry about.
You shot her in cold blood!
What is at stake here far outweighs our personal interests, I should...
Our "personal interests"??? I'm talking about my sister's life!
She was my other half!!
Calm down, Emily! Calm down!
Louis, don't come near me!
I warned you what would happen if I found her!
She may as well kill the bitch! It doesn't matter now!
You can go ahead and kill her, I don't care any more!
Louis, please. Don't think you can play me for a fool!
She's not my mother, Emily.
She abducted me at birth and spent her life telling me lies.
So go right ahead and shoot her. You'd be doing me a favour.
Louis! No! You're wrong!
I never wanted this!
You've always lied to me...
Persuade her not to shoot.
MIND READER
I was so hoping it wouldn't end like this...
I'm fed up with all these deaths...
Lower your arm.
Emily... Put the weapon down.
She... she has to pay for all the harm she's done to me.
Well, to be fair, we've all made mistakes.
And look at her, Emily. She's paid for hers.
I'm all alone now...
Sarah didn't kill Emma.
Emily, you know full well that it wasn't Sarah who killed Emma.
If it weren't for her, none of this would have happened!
Maybe. But you can't accuse her of this murder.
You're the one who fired, Emily.
Shut up!!!
Louis... you had better choose your words a little more carefully, don't you think?
No one's going to die here.
Listen, Emily, we've all gone through some horrible experiences since we arrived here.
I can assure you, we'd all rather be somewhere else.
She betrayed my sister...
She has to pay, Louis.
We've had enough people die here, don't you think?
Look at her, Emily. Don't you think she's paid enough?
But... I...
You are not a murderer.
Emily, calm down.
You're not like them.
You're not a murderer!
Is that so? And what do you think we were doing for the Order, then?
And for the crown of England? Why do you think the Order contacted me?
Silent! Methodical! No one ever suspected us! We always covered for each other!
Duchess, I am sorry for what happened.
I didn't have any choice...
Ah, you! Shut your mouth!
You had a choice alright!!
You use people according to your own desires, without any scruples!
Excuse me, Duchess, but we're in the same line of business!
Shut it!
And as for Emma, she knew only too well!
No, Emily! Look at me!
Emily!
What did you say?
MIND READER
No! I'm not like her! And never will be!!
Look at me!!
Look at me!!
Say that again!
LOOK AT ME, EMILY!
Emma knew the risks of the job only too well!
You're constantly risking your life to serve the Order.
You knew the risks involved!
We were supposed to rely on our own people, Sarah.
You were her superior in the Order, she trusted you!
If Sarah must die, I must be by MY hand!
Emily! No! If she has to die, it will be by MY hand!
That bitch lied to me all my life, Emily!
Louis... What's...
Shut up!
You lied to me!!
What are you talking about?
If she has to die, I'm the one who's gonna do it!
Louis, no...
What did he tell you?
You are not like Sarah!
You're not like her!
Neither you nor Emma are like Sarah.
Ever since you got here, you've always tried to help me.
I trust you, Emily.
And Emma would never have betrayed me, either.
No, she...she wasn't like that.
She was loyal.
Don't make the same mistake again!
Emily! No! Don't let your anger control you again!
We both know very well what happened in your room, with Emma...
Whose fault was that, Louis?
Who found nothing better to do than come between us?
Who!!
I'm sorry.
But why did Sarah betray Emma?
Why?!
I... Your sister was supposed to hide something!
And no one was supposed to have been able to find it.
And? She would never have talked!
Even under torture! So why get rid of her?
Unfortunately Emily, the creatures who live here employ methods that no one can resist.
I was going to get her out of there, for God's sake!
So what are you talking about?
MIND READER
Don't tell me Emma died because of that book...
I HAVE TO KNOW!! ANYTHING BUT THAT DAMNED BOOK!!
Al Azif had to disappear!
Emily, Emma had in her possession an ancient book of the occult that couldn't fall into the wrong hands!
What?
You're telling me that Emma died because of an old book?
That's why my sister died!
No, you don't understand!
So you won't be shocked if I return the favor in that case, will you?
Emma would have cracked
Emily, Emma would have never been able to resist Holm or Mortimer.
Emma was working for Holm! She had nothing to fear from him!
Indeed, it was he who treated her after your mother left her for dead!
And Mortimer would never have gotten the better of her, especially not with Holm's protection!
I've had enough! I'm going to shoot your mother!
She won't believe me if I tell her
Emily, all I ask is that you let me tell the truth!
But you'll never believe me....
You leave me no choice... I'm going to kill her, Louis!
Mortimer is a Daemon.
Emily, Mortimer is a Daemon... in the literal sense of the word.
What are you...
Lord Mortimer has been around since the third crusade.
He fiddles with his family records so he can keep maintaining his identity.
I know it sounds crazy, but I swear on everything I hold dear, that's the truth!
What? But when did...
We've all fallen into a trap by coming here!
You, Emma, me, Sarah, and all the guests.
We're serving beings that are infinitely more powerful than we are. Look at them, they're governing the world by manipulating us!
I'm sure that Sir Gregory has regularly asked you for information about the Queen or the King. Isn't that right?
I... Yes... But that doesn't...
Mortimer and Holm were looking to recover an ancient grimoire that contains, I don't even know what dark secret powers.
Sarah did everything she could to stop them from getting their hands on it.
Emma is another victim, just like every one of us here.
They are the real culprits!
Mortimer can read peoples' minds
Mortimer and Holm can read our very thoughts...
Wh...what?
Emma would have never been able to resist them.
What are you talking about?
Mortimer has the power to read thoughts.
That's impossible...
And yet, he has found a way.
It wouldn't even have been difficult for him to get into her mind.
Look what they did to that poor girl, Elizabeth.
Look at Péru! He was pushed right to the edge, year after year.
I can't believe it.
I promise you, it's the truth.
Good Outcome
Louis... I...
Do you realize what you are asking me to believe?
I know. But it's the truth, Emily.
How do you expect me to accept this? We are in the Golden Order precisely to fight against such beliefs!
Do you remember those deeds we found behind the chimney. They weren't fake.
There's a reason why they're all signed by his same hand.
Daemons?...
In his study, he keeps the Mortimer family tree.
They produced only boys, just one per generation, since the third crusade. And they are all called William.
He justifies his own existence, Emily.
Look, I'm going to believe you.
But if you're taking me for a ride...
Unfortunately for us, it'd be impossible to even make up a story like that.
Alright, I believe you...
Thank him, you owe him your life.
I have always been very lucky to...
...have him as my son.
Bad Outcome
I understand you were trying to protect her, Louis, but it's a lost cause!
Don't move!
Louis, remember in Paris...
Oh no! Not again!
No, Mother, wait!
ACT
No!
NO, FOR GOD'S SAKE!!
Did she hit you?
NO!! Why did you do that? I could have calmed her down!!
That's enough!
I've had enough...
What do you mean?
TRUST
No, no, NO!
Come on Mother, hang in there, you're gonna pull through!
Save your strength, I'm getting you out of here!
It's... It's too late.
Don't trust him!
I'm proud of you, my son...
NO!!!
MOTHER!!!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
FINISH OFF EMILY
You go to hell!
LEAVE HER
You shot her in cold blood!
What is at stake here far outweighs our personal interests, I should...
Our "personal interests"??? I'm talking about my sister's life!
She was my other half!!
Calm down, Emily! Calm down!
Louis, don't come near me!

She may as well kill the bitch! It doesn't matter now!

NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
FINSIH OFF EMILY
You go to hell!
LEAVE HER
You manipulated us all!
You're going to pay!
What is at stake here far outweighs our personal interests, I'm...
Our "personal interests"??? You betrayed me!
Emily, no...
MINDREADER
What an idiot, he still doesn't get it.
It won't bring Emma back to life
It won't bring Emma back.
Don't let your anger get the better of you.
What do you mean, “you betrayed me”?
But...
Wait! How has Sarah betrayed you?
I don't believe it! You still don't get it!
I'm not Emily, stupid!
You went as far as killing your own sister!?
You're the one who pointed her out!
You only have yourself to blame!
And even after going to bed with her, you were incapable of telling us apart!
Oh dear God...!
Surprise, Sarah.
You can't just get rid of me like that, you old hag!
Do you realize what you did?
MIND READER
Oh, poor Louis, he's upset about me getting rid of his little sweetheart...
Why did you trick your sister?
Emma, you tricked your sister...
She looked for you everywhere!
You're lying! She wasted her time hovering around you!
No... You're wrong, Emma...
She was ready to kill me if it would have brought you back.
She was supposed to lay into you! She was supposed to get even for me…
Emily was right.
She wouldn't have made me pay for someone else's mistakes.
You're not getting away with it this time
Your dual identity has just been ripped to shreds! You're not going be able to hide anymore.
Hide?
You still don't get it. Don't be a fool.
I am the only Duchess Hillsborrow now. I am free!
Emily loved you
Emily loved you, Emma.
You endured everything together, you were never alone!
It's... You have no idea what I had to endure...
But it must have been the same for Emily. You both went through so much.
She always saved the worst situations for me!
How many times have I had to climb into bed with some man I'd never even seen before, because Emily had seduced him during the day.
Emma, it's obvious you've suffered a great deal because of the path your lives took.
But don't try convincing yourself that your sister didn't suffer too.
Duchess, I am sorry about what happened.
You had a choice!!
You use people according to your desires, without any scruples!
Excuse me, but we are in the same line of business!
SHUT IT!
And Emily knew it very well!
No, Emma! Look at me!
She would never endanger herself for the sake of the Order!
Her sense of duty gave way to her personal interests!
In the end, Sir Gregory was the only one who was truly honest with me.
He has opened my eyes more in two days than my sister did in a whole lifetime!
Sir Gregory?
You've got to be joking, right?  You're not really gonna trust him, are you?
MIND READER
I trust Gregory. He's always honest with me...
Why follow Holm?
Emma, why do you follow Holm?
Why? Why?
Always questions!
Just shut up, for God's sake!
Holm manipulates us
Emma, you don't realize!
You're just a pawn to Sir Gregory, like the rest of us...
He has never lied to me! He took me in, took care of me!
Something that no one else has ever done for me!
But why did he do it?
You didn't have any particular item, which he desperately wanted you to give him, for example?
No... I...
Emma, you are the only one who knows where the Al Azif is hidden
He's using you...
It's... that...
It's all Mortimer's fault!
Mortimer is responsible for his share of all of this. But he's not playing alone.
Holm is serving his own interests, too.
She ought to trust Mortimer
Well, it looks like you've backed the wrong horse...
You'll lose everything if you follow Sir Gregory. Mortimer will win, Emma.
And you should be on his side.
Never! That bastard betrayed me like all the rest of them!
I will never sink so low as to serve him! Do you understand me!?
You deserve more than that
Emma, take a moment to consider this, I beg you.
I don't think you're fully aware of the situation.
With all you've suffered under Emily's thumb, you really ought to flee Sir Gregory.
Gregory has always shown me that he cares about me...
He's using you. He feeds off your hatred of Mortimer, and me, and your sister...
You mustn't let him do that.
No... I...
No one will ever use me again...
No, I refuse.. it isn't fair...
There's been enough deaths...
MIND READER
No, it isn't fair!
I haven't done all this for nothing!! Holm promised me I could be the only Duchess Hillsborrow from now on!
Lower your arm, Emma!
Lower your weapon, Emma...
No... I've gone too far to stop here!
You are trying to manipulate me again, I can tell!
No, why do you say that?
That poor Emma is stupid! She would swallow any story you wanted, wouldn't she?
No one will ever manipulate me again!
That's enough, she's finished!
It's all over for you.
You're going to have some explaining to do after all of this.
What? Are you threatening me?
Do you really think you are in a position to do so?
And what if I take your mother out first? At the stage I'm at...
Play on her fantasy of being the Duchess
Unless you decide to kill everyone on this island, you'll have to explain your actions once you get back.
All this effort to become the only Duchess Hillsborrow, ruined in an instant..
She betrayed me!!
You will be tracked down.
Hunted! Like a criminal.
...
In the end, there will have only been one Duchess Hillsborrow. Emil...
I AM Duchess Hillsborrow!
Mortimer is a Daemon!
Mortimer is a Daemon...
In the literal sense of the word.
He and Sir Gregory have been living amongst us for several centuries now.
I know, Louis.
What?? You knew?
Of course! And they can even read our thoughts, would you believe that!
But it makes no difference!
I serve Gregory!
Mortimer can drop dead! He absolutely deserves it.
Get it off your chest, Louis
Emma...
Stop it...
Come with me.
...
She deserves to die, Louis!
Every word she utters is a lie!
I'm not joking! You should never believe what she says!
One day, she will betray you too!
She already has. I've just found out she's not my mother, Emma.
Good Outcome
You will not die by my hand today, Sarah.
She deserves to die.
In fact, I think that honor goes to you.
Bad Outcome
She should never have tried to shoot me...
Emma, no...
Don't move!
Louis, remember in Paris...
I trust you, son...
NOW, LOUIS!
No!
NO, DAMMIT!!
aaaaaahhh...
NO!! Why did you do that?
Louis...
No, no, NO!
Come on, Mother! Hang in there, you're gonna get through this!
Do not... trust him!
I am proud... of you... my son...
NO!!!
MOTHER!!!
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
Shoot Emma
It's just you and me now...
Let her go
Where is the Al Azif?
Sir Gregory planned to get it off the island by boat.
I wouldn't be surprised if he sends it with the next shipment for the continent. But I don't know when that is.
You manipulated us all!
You're going to pay!
What is at stake here far outweighs our personal interests, I'm...
Our "personal interests"??? You betrayed me!
Emily, no...
MINDREADER
What an idiot, he still doesn't get it.
It won't bring Emma back to life
It won't bring Emma back.

That poor Emma is stupid! She would swallow any story you wanted, wouldn't she?
No one will ever manipulate me again!
That's enough, she's finished!
It's all over for you.
You're going to have some explaining to do after all of this.
What? Are you threatening me?
Do you really think you are in a position to do so?
And what if I take your mother out first? At the stage I'm at...
Play on her fantasy of being the Duchess
Unless you decide to kill everyone on this island, you'll have to explain your actions once you get back.
All this effort to become the only Duchess Hillsborrow, ruined in an instant..
She betrayed me!!
You will be tracked down.
Hunted! Like a criminal.
...
In the end, there will have only been one Duchess Hillsborrow. Emil...
I AM Duchess Hillsborrow!
Mortimer is a Daemon!
Mortimer is a Daemon...
In the literal sense of the word.
He and Sir Gregory have been living amongst us for several centuries now.
I know, Louis.
What?? You knew?
Of course! And they can even read our thoughts, would you believe that!
But it makes no difference!
I serve Gregory!
Mortimer can drop dead! He absolutely deserves it.
Get it off your chest, Louis
Emma...
Stop it...
Come with me.
...
She deserves to die, Louis!
Every word she utters is a lie!
I'm not joking! You should never believe what she says!
One day, she will betray you too!
She already has. I've just found out she's not my mother, Emma.
Good Outcome
You will not die by my hand today, Sarah.
She deserves to die.
In fact, I think that honor goes to you.
Bad Outcome
She should never have tried to shoot me...
Emma, no...
Don't move!
Louis, remember in Paris...
I trust you, son...
NOW, LOUIS!
No!
NO, DAMMIT!!
aaaaaahhh...
NO!! Why did you do that?
Louis...
No, no, NO!
Come on, Mother! Hang in there, you're gonna get through this!
Do not... trust him!
I am proud... of you... my son...
NO!!!
MOTHER!!!
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
Shoot Emma
It's just you and me now...
Let her go
Where is the Al Azif?
Sir Gregory planned to get it off the island by boat.
I wouldn't be surprised if he sends it with the next shipment for the continent. But I don't know when that is.
I found out some information about Al Azif
I could have obtained some information about Al Azif
I arrived at the Wharf before Sarah de Richet was wounded
I did not arrive in time to save Sarah de Richet
I stopped Napoleon Bonaparte from getting the lance
I lost the Lance of Longinus to Napoleon Bonaparte
I persuaded Jacques Péru not to shoot
I failed to persuade Péru to lower his arm
I killed Sarah de Richet
I let Sarah de Richet go
I stopped Lady Hillsborrow from shooting Sarah de Richet
I did not stop Lady Hillsborrow from shooting Sarah de Richet
I saw Sarah de Richet kill Lady Hillsborrow
I killed Lady Hillsborrow
I asked Lord Mortimer to save Jacques Péru
I let Lord Mortimer kill Jacques Péru
I found out about Sarah de Richet's lie
I did not find out about Sarah de Richet's lie
Lord Mortimer taught me to read minds
I chose to trust Sarah de Richet when she was threatened
I chose to act when Sarah de Richet was threatened
I could have had a conversation with Jacques Péru
I had a conversation with Jacques Péru
I had a discussion with Manuel Godoy
I could have had a discussion with Manuel Godoy
I floored Napolean Bonaparte 
I was floored by Napoleon Bonaparte
I found out about my Daemon nature
It's not that I regret all these discussions but I must hurry to the wharf!
It's not that I regret all these discussions but I must hurry to the wharf!
I'm already pressed for time as it is! Mother's waiting for me on the wharf.
I'm already pressed for time as it is! Mother's waiting for me on the wharf.
Ah, Louis.
Perfect timing.
As luck would have it...
Come my boy, I would like to have a word with you.
Ah, Louis.
Perfect timing.
As luck would have it...
Come my boy, I would like to have a word with you.
Not too shaken up?
You've experienced many significant events since your arrival.
Yes
You can say that again.
No
No, not really.
I'm impressed by your ability to remain composed, not to let yourself become overwhelmed by your emotions.
I don't really know.
To tell you the truth, I don't get much time to ask myself those questions.
Quite right, best not react to all this too suddenly. Take some time to think about it all..
For now, I think you ought to find Sarah, my son.
You ought to talk things over with her.
So she's been lying to me all along?
Let her justify herself. What's done is done. Sarah must explain herself.
You must clear the air.
We'll have all the time we need to talk afterwards.
But all in good time.
B... before you join her, I'd like to give you something.
As a Daemon, I would like to introduce you to your first talent.
What do you mean?
Open your mind, my son.
Relax. You hold immense power.
It's already there, inside you. Empty your mind of all thoughts...
Just let me show you the way.
I should relax...
Open your mind...
Hear my voice...
Feel the vibrations and listen to what has been happening to you, deep inside, but which you have been concealing...
Trust yourself... It's all already in there...
I... I can hear something...
Now breathe...
It's... a sound, ver... very faint...
That's right... Concentrate on it... my voice is growing fainter but I am here...
I... whispers... words... mixed voices...
Focus on one of them...
Don't be afraid.
I... I sense a stream... some words are clear but not all of them...
Let them enter into your mind.
I... hear them... Now... now I can hear a clear voice!
Well done, Louis.
Congratulations.
What was it?
You are now able to read people's minds.
Wha.. I... what?
You heard me.
From now on, whenever a human speaks to you, you will be able to read their current thoughts.
So, if you need to know something in particular from someone, all you have to do is make them think about it.
But I would break their spirit, wouldn't I?
But... I'd be violating their minds, wouldn't I?
No, no, nothing of the sort.
You won't really be penetrating their psyches.
Let's just say you'll be picking up residual signals emitted by their thoughts.
It isn't intrusive at all, rest assured.
But it would be a violation of their privacy, wouldn't it?
But it... it'd be a violation of their most intimate thoughts, wouldn't it?
To begin with, there's nothing obliging you to do it. You already had the ability without even knowing it.
I just gave you the option of putting it into practice, if you want.
Moreover, it would be wrong to evoke morality here...
Every species is different, Louis. And this is the way we are made, that's all there is to it.
You are free to use this talent or not, and what's more, it will be up to you to decide what to do with the thoughts you read.
That is where the values of right and wrong do come into play.
Great!
Hang on, you mean to say that if someone lies to me, that I will know?
Exactly.
But... but that's... that's just incredible!!
You still need to practice, though.
There are also a few rules you need to know that govern this talent when used between ourselves.
You can read the thoughts of Daemons as well as of humans.
But be careful!
A Daemon more experienced than yourself will know that you are spying, and will often react quite violently.
It's considered bad form to play around the psyche of another Daemon. It's a question of courtesy.
But let's be clear... what is most considered bad form is getting caught.
So I would advise against trying to read the thoughts of Gregory, for example.
Holm?
Yes, the old grump is touchy and rather a stickler about the conventions.
On that note, go and see Sarah, Louis. Otherwise she might leave without you.
We'll continue this discussion later, if you want. Just join me in my study when you're finished.
I'm off
You're right, I need to go now.
See you later, Lord Mortimer.
See you later, Lord Mortimer.
See you later, Father.
See you later, Father.
Use Mindreader on Mortimer
Let's see what Mortimer is thinking about.
He is thinking he might not have been clear enough with you.
When I told you not to try to read into Gregory or other experienced Daemons, it also applied to me, of course!
You... you can hear me think?
Of course I can.
I can sense you. For the moment your mind shines like a thousand lights because you haven't yet mastered the art of concealment from the psyches of others.
So, I give you a weapon and the first thing you do is try to shoot me with it?
If my intentions were evil, you would already be at my mercy.
So be very careful on whom you use the talent.
Apologize
Alright. Please excuse me, I...
And don't ever apologize, my son. You are far above that, from now on.
Now go...
Leave
Alright.
On that note, I'd better be going, I'm expected.
One more thing.
If you want to know the truth about your birth, ask her about Paris, 1763. At 12, rue des Martyrs.
That's where she disemboweled your mother to steal you from me.
Not too shaken up?
You've experienced many significant events since your arrival.
Yes
You can say that again.
No
No, not really.
I'm impressed by your ability to remain composed, not to let yourself become overwhelmed by your emotions.
I don't really know.

One more thing.
If you want to know the truth about your birth, ask her about Paris, 1763. At 12, rue des Martyrs.
That's where she disemboweled your mother to steal you from me.
Come closer, please.
It's time we had a little chat.
I wanted you...
Oh no, your hand!!...
Dammit, no!!
So that's it, she is prepared to use you...
What do you mean?
It wasn't enough for her to lose her hand. She had to make you lose yours too.
I cannot permit this to continue...
What's... What's wrong, my Lord?
Tell me, what's with all the bodyguards?
Louis, it's time you found out the truth.
I've been observing you since you arrived.
I see you running all over the grounds, in search of Sarah.
I would like to prevent her from leading you even further down the wrong road.
That is?
The wrong road?
Louis, Sarah has made her own choices.
Of her own free will.
And I would like for you to have the same chance.
Say nothing
You see, Sarah and I have known each other for a very long time, Louis.
I am aware of her theory.
About me...
About Gregory...
About the Daemons.
And it's false.
So you're gonna tell me she is wrong?...And that she's a liar?
And she says the truth
And it's true.
Say nothing
And she is right.
Look at me. I have inhabited this body since 1191. For the last 602 years I have been this dear William Mortimer.
He is the devil.
You're the devil incarnate!
The devil?
I'm not saying that all Judaeo-Christian folklore hasn't served us, but the truth is, of course, something quite different.
Please don't look at us through the primitive prism of religions.
I am not hiding any horns or goat's feet, Louis. I have no tail.
That folklore?
Why do you bring up folklore?
You mean that you've taken advantage of people's beliefs?
No, not exactly.
I mean that we in fact created them from scratch.
It is amazing to see how Mankind has such a strong need to believe in something superior to itself.
It was very instructive for what was to come.
Go back
Since when have the Daemons been among us?
You've been Mortimer for 600 years? How long have the Daemons been among Mankind?
I don't think I'd be lying if I said that we have always been here.
Speak about certain historical events.
If I follow you, you must have witnessed some of the greatest moments in History.
You could certainly say that, yes.
Ancient Egypt?
Did you know Ancient Egypt?
Oh, yes, yes. We were Gods on earth in those days.
What did Men call you then?
Amenhotep IV.
The...
The tenth pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty?
Oh, I see you're a connoisseur, Louis. Impressive.
The Greeks?
Did you know Ancient Greece?
In many ways, yes.
One day Pericles, the next Parmenides.
Just the memory of the time I spent working on acoustics with Pythagoras... Well, it... it moves me quite deeply, to tell the truth.
Pericles? He's the one who brought Athens to its golden age, isn't he?
In a way, yes.
He established democracy, and then died during an epidemic. It wasn't so long after his two sons passed away, isn't that right?
Excuse me Louis, I... I would rather not relive any more of that, if you don't mind.
Ancient Rome?
Did you experience Ancient Rome?
Oh yes. Luxury and decadence, Louis.
My family did indeed reign supreme, but from this period I retain only the works of my friend, Marcus Vitruvius Pollio.
The death of Christ?
You seem to be fascinated by Christ. He...You weren't him, were you?
Oh, no, no. No, not at all.
He was my father, though, strange as it seems.
... I beg your pardon?
Am I dreaming? Please, tell me I'm dreaming!
We shall have a chance to talk about all that again later, but yes, yes, he was my father.
All the mythology surrounding Jesus of Nazareth really stems from my Father's prideful need to show himself among men.
The great Crusades?
I've noticed that you have a passion for the Crusades.
Among other things, yes.
Mainly the third.
It was during the siege of Saint Joan of Arc that I took possession of Lord Mortimer.
And you've never changed "skins" or "bodies" since?
I have used other envelopes but only to carry out very short tasks.
Apart from that, indeed I have been able to retain the identity of William Alexander Mortimer throughout the centuries.
I know enough
Go back
How many of you are there?
"Lucifer, the fallen archangel, left heaven accompanied by 133 306 668 angels."
Is it true that there are that many of you?
No, I assure you, Louis. Forget your Bible class, it's ridiculous.
We are not angels, we don't have wings.
There is certainly nowhere near a million of us and for that matter, no sacred human text represents us correctly.
There are several families and the family to which I belong has 8 siblings, including Gregory and myself.
Sir Gregory is your brother?
Yes... what can I say? You can't choose your family.
But it is very difficult to know exactly how many of us there are because a large number of our kind remain hidden or never reveal themselves even to us.
Do they manipulate thoughts?
And you truly have the power to manipulate the thoughts of Men?
That's right. Every Daemon has the capacity to infiltrate the minds of Men and to read and steer their thoughts.
To what end?
And what do you do with this power?
We help them, of course.
Rubbish!
Of course you do...
And you expect me to believe that, I suppose?
Louis, "Daemon" is just a word.
It all depends on what exists beneath the surface.
I understand that this isn't easy.
The culture of Men is centered on the fact that Daemons are responsible for all the evils on earth.
But if it's the same in every single culture, then maybe there might be something to it, don't you think?
Certainly, there is something to it.
Control. Man has spent his existence wishing to believe in the supernatural, and imposing his belief on others.
What could be more convenient for manipulating the masses?
A perfect inaccessible being and a plethora of Daemons, in every one...
The perfect idea to relieve Men of all responsibility, while still finding them guilty.
What do you mean?
And how is it you help Men exactly?
Let's just say that without us, Man would probably never have left his cave.
Fire, the wheel, tools, writing...
We are the spark that inspires Man to search, to grow, to evolve...
What are these powers exactly?
Can you tell me more about your capacities, your supernatural powers?
Supernatural? From my point of view, they are perfectly natural.
Well Louis, just because the monkey does not fly doesn't mean that we should consider the bird a supernatural creature.
We are all part of a grand design.
We are simply made like this.
By developing our art, we are able to read thoughts as well as write in the minds of Men.
It is possible for us to make them bow to our desire, but it doesn't work without leaving some scars.
Go back
Other questions
How can I believe him?
Why should I trust you?
I'm not asking you to, Louis.
If you are still in doubt about the Daemons, I can assure you that won't last long.
Why tell me all this?
But why me?
Why do I tell you about the greatest secret ever revealed to Man?
It's..
That's right...
I'm coming to that.
Don't worry...
What's happening with my mother?
What has my mother got to do with all this?
She embarked on a crusade, many years ago.
To kill all the Daemons.
How did he react to that?
That must have upset you.
I imagine you retaliated...
No...
I`m afraid she never forgave me.
Forgave what?
We met when she was still just a young woman.
I appeared to her in a different form because I didn't want to reveal the identity of Lord Mortimer at that time.
She was looking for someone interested in the occult to decipher an ancient book.
We spent many years together, until I revealed my true nature to her.
Was it Al Azif?
The old book was Al Azif, wasn't it?
Did she speak about it?
Not so long ago, yes.
Indeed, it was already Al Azif. She wanted to unlock the secrets.
And then?
What happened next?
She felt betrayed, manipulated, tricked.
We had an argument, she rejected me and then she simply disappeared.
Just after that she joined the Order and began to relentlesly hunt us down.
Go back
What are their intentions regarding men?
What are the Daemons` projects for humanity?
Our aim has long since been to protect humanity from itself.
On the other hand, although we give them the impulse to succeed,
we don't all agree as to the path they take to achieve it...
What exactly is a Daemon?
How would you qualify your species, scientifically?
Good question. What is you area of expertise?
Physics
I'd say Physics.
So consider us like the mechanical vibration of fluids.
You mean sound?
That's right. The physical properties of acoustics are very similar to those of our abilities.
Imagine us as something like waves.
Biology
I would say Biology.
So I would class Daemons along with parasites.
The comparison's not very flattering...
You live inside a host and you feed on that host, do you not?
A large number of parasites are essential to the survival of their bearer, you know.
We do indeed choose a host, we enter inside them and we evolve with them.
But if you prefer a more philosophical approach, or a more poetical one, consider us as an idea.
We are an idea that penetrates the human spirit.
But in fact, in no way are we a danger for our hosts. Quite the contrary, we strengthen them.
Philosophy
Given the choice, I'd choose philosophy.
So consider us as an idea, Louis.
We are but a word in the minds of Men. But this word is capable of anything.
Empires have been built on words.
I am not a scientist...
My Lord, to tell you the truth I don't see myself as a scientist.
Well, consider us as a simple species still unknown to most of Men.
Thus we are born. We have the capacity to change bodies, that is all.
Previous questions
Pass...
Continue...
Louis... It's time you opened your eyes.
Come, you'll soon see.
After you.
Why a conference instead of imposing your will upon us?
If you could manipulate us mentally, what's the point of all the theatrics of the conference?
You must suspect that we asked ourselves that very same question.
For many centuries we didn't organize any conferences.
And most of the time it ended in civil war between Daemons. Many of us were killed during this period.
The idea of organizing conferences was the answer to everything.
The interest being to erect some rules among ourselves.
Our family first divided up all the principal countries of the world.
Now whenever one of us wants to propose a major change between these countries, they summon the Daemon in question and initiate a conference.
The Daemon that initiates the proposition doesn't have to give notification of the subject of the conference beforehand, consequently we participate along with our best assets.
Once the humans are brought together, the conference begins but we are forbidden to use our talents to influence the participants.
The first meeting is held in order to expose the subject to all the participants, followed by several days of reflection during which we are allowed to be persuasive but not to impose our will.
A second meeting closes the conference with a final vote.
So... for you it's a game, isn't it?
I understand your remark but after living several centuries, you stand back and enjoy what reflection and pleasure you can...
How do they decide on global policy?
But how do you agree on global policy?
Locally we often have competing interests and sometimes we start wars between Men, which are linked to our disagreements.
Most of the time our Father steps in and gives directives, which my family follow to the letter.
Indeed, in my opinion it is high time we moved on.
What do you mean?
I mean that a new era must begin.
The old monarchic regimes are outdated and it's time to evolve.
Go back
Was von Borchert working for you?
So, von Borchert... He was looking for the Al Azif for you?
Exactly.
Al Azif has always belonged to my family, Louis.
And with good reason, my father wrote much of it.
Can you tell me what you've done with...?
What? You mean, the Al Azif?
No, I already know that: Sarah came here with it and got rid of it...
I was thinking of von Borchert.
He isn't essential but he is a trusted person.
Uh, about him...Uh... How can I put this...?
Ah, I see.
Well, he jumped me, it was him or me...
You don't need to justify yourself, Louis. Don't worry.
He is a prisoner at our headquarters, in Paris.
Alright.
Is there a connection with Elizabeth?
Did what happened to Elizabeth Adams have anything to do with you?
Unfortunately, the poor girl became an issue between us, in spite of herself...
A family of Daemons is still a family, and as in all families, there are disputes.
Elizabeth's family, the Adams, has always been under the patriarchal control of my Father.
As he and myself are not really on very good terms, sending poor Elizabeth here was terribly rude of him, really.
You did accept, though...
No... I would say rather I was presented with the fait accompli by Gregory, and went along with the intention of helping her.
But this is my castle and everyone is the master of their own home.
You controlled her so she would commit suicide!
I knew it!
I know you did. Moreover, you impressed me.
You really did sense what had happened, but you couldn't quite explain how.
A good job too, because for a moment I was afraid you would prove the theory right in front of Gregory.
But why?
Well, she was my Father's eyes and ears and Gregory took a malicious delight in walking her all over the manor to spy on me.
He would be furious if he knew I had prevented Father from being able to check up on what was happening here.
And so...
It was you who killed her!
The child was already condemned, Louis. My Father would never have let her be.
I had to pass inside her mind and, yes, make her take her own life.
Trapped between the unyielding control of my Father and your mother's terrible treatments? I wouldn't wish a life like that on anyone. Would you?
So neither my mother nor Péru were ever guilty?
You just gave me the runaround with that whole investigation.
Now, don't take it the wrong way. I was obliged to keep up appearances so that Gregory wouldn't suspect me.
And it enabled me to size you up, Louis.
So...
The voice in Elizabeth's head, it was you!
It was my Father, to be precise.
So then...
You're the one who killed her!
Yet president Washington told me that Péru was guilty.
George only gave you the official version.
Don't hold it against him. He doesn't know the truth.
The poor girl was condemned, Louis.
Don't you think it better that she stop living like a slave, being mentally raped by my father since the day she was born?
You're not wrong
Maybe you're right.
Certainly not
You're joking!
You don't know everything, she might have recovered from everything she had suffered.
Between the unyielding control of my Father and your mother's terrible treatments, I wouldn't wish a life like that on anyone.
But it is also true, I felt obliged to get rid of her.
You'll understand one day, you'll see.
Go back
Look, I understand everything you say but I actually do have one question, why do you surround yourself with all these servants?
Oh, rest assured, they're not here for you but for me.
They're here to protect me.
Protect you? From whom? Me?
Well, let's just say that you have the Lance and that Sarah has made you believe I'm dangerous.
I would like to avoid any unfortunate mishaps.
But with you being a Daemon, I... I'd have thought you could order me not to attack you.
Naturally, but my aim was to have that happen without resorting to my talent.
Pass...
...
I hope I've answered all your questions, Louis.
Come, I've something to show you...
There... There is one question that remains to be answered...
Why me?
Why tell me all of this?
Oh! Haven't you guessed yet?
Absolutely not.
I really have no idea.
Come on Louis, make an effort.
What do you think could be the reason?
He needs me
I mean, it's obvious you want me on your side, but...
...that doesn't explain why you're telling me all these truths.
Louis, this conference is indeed of capital importance to me.
And yes, I want you on my side.
But that's not the main reason that compels me to confide in you.
What is it then?
He needs the support of the Order
I think you sorely need the Golden Order and you want to make sure you've got it.
Really?
You really think I'm that desperate?
Well, I did think so, but now I'm not so sure...
He wants to retrieve the spear
My Lord, I don't know if I can answer in all honesty.
Please do, Louis. You can say anything to me, believe me.
You must admit, being surrounded by all these servants isn't doing much to relax me.
Forget the servants.
They're only here to ensure my safety.
Why? What are you afraid of?
Well I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea, Louis...
But you have spent your entire life fighting the occult, you have just stolen the Holy Lance from me, and I do happen to be a Daemon.
Do you not realize the power that relic has on a Daemon?
No, I know its power
You... You mean to tell me the Lance can kill a Daemon?
The Lance is marked with my Father's blood.
It has acquired the capacity to block us inside our host.
If a Daemon got injured by the Holy Lance, they wouldn't be able to change bodies.
If the wound were mortal, the Daemon would surely die!
Wait, hang on a minute...
Did you just say that Jesus Christ was your father?
That's right.
It corresponds to one of the periods when my father had a dire need to show himself to Men.
You see what that led to...
So you're telling me that all of Christendom has been built on the myth of a Daemon?
Ironic, don't you think?
But it is essential that Men remain oblivious to that fact, Louis.
I'll let you imagine the cataclysm that would erupt and tear through all of the religions, if ever they found out the truth.
Yes, I've no idea.
Well, that's true.
Sarah must have told you, didn't she?
It surprises me that you've wasted all this time looking for the Lance, instead of fleeing.
You know I know, don't you?
Let's say I think you know enough to doubt that you could be persuaded to leave without a reason.
Am I right?
The Lance is supposed to kill Daemons, right?
And indeed it can... At least, some of them...
That's why I've chosen to protect myself. You never know.
Just imagine if Sarah wanted to get rid of me through you!
Because that's exactly what she wants to do, isn't it Louis?
Yes
Indeed it is.
Of course..
Except that, she hasn't told you everything, Louis.
That's why this discussion is so essential.
No
Not that I know of, no.
Not with me, please.
Sarah has dedicated her life to hunting us down.
We both know her greatest wish is to see me dead.
However, she hasn't told you everything, Louis.
I can see where he's going with this.
I've got an idea... but it might seem stupid.
Trust me...
Am I one?
I mean, am I a Daemon?
Would you like that?
Yes
I must admit that the idea is appealing.
No
No, I don't think so.
I'm just a Man and that's fine with me.
Look...
We are of the Gods, Louis. Always have been.
You, as much as me...
You are one of us, Louis. You too are a Daemon.
Are you serious?
You know it... Deep down inside, you know I am telling you the truth.
Where do you think that natural charismatic presence comes from?
Your talent must already have manifested itself somehow.
Have you ever had any visions?
No... stop it, it's absurd...
Have you never found yourself suddenly inside someone else's body without knowing why?
No!
Whilst asleep, maybe?
That's how it often happens the first time. Your spirit wanders unconsciously.
My mother can't have lied to me about that!
It's true... your real mother would never have lied to you!
I... what do you mean?
Louis... I would rather you found this out from her own lips, but it's important that you know...
Sarah is not your mother.
I... What?
I'm sorry you had to find out this way, Louis, but you must know the truth before you commit an irreparable act.
No, I... No...
No, it's not possible...
You are my son...
Come closer, please.
It's time we had a little chat.
I wanted you...
Oh no, your hand!!...
Dammit, no!!
So that's it, she is prepared to use you...
What do you mean?
It wasn't enough for her to lose her hand. She had to make you lose yours too.
I cannot permit this to continue...
What's... What's wrong, my Lord?
Tell me, what's with all the bodyguards?
Louis, it's time you found out the truth.
I've been observing you since you arrived.
I see you running all over the grounds, in search of Sarah.
I would like to prevent her from leading you even further down the wrong road.
That is?
The wrong road?
Louis, Sarah has made her own choices.
Of her own free will.
And I would like for you to have the same chance.
Say nothing
You see, Sarah and I have known each other for a very long time, Louis.
I am aware of her theory.
About me...
About Gregory...
About the Daemons.
And it's false.
So you're gonna tell me she is wrong?...And that she's a liar?
And she says the truth
And it's true.
Say nothing
And she is right.
Look at me. I have inhabited this body since 1191. For the last 602 years I have been this dear William Mortimer.
He is the devil.
You're the devil incarnate!
The devil?
I'm not saying that all Judaeo-Christian folklore hasn't served us, but the truth is, of course, something quite different.
Please don't look at us through the primitive prism of religions.
I am not hiding any horns or goat's feet, Louis. I have no tail.
That folklore?
Why do you bring up folklore?
You mean that you've taken advantage of people's beliefs?
No, not exactly.
I mean that we in fact created them from scratch.
It is amazing to see how Mankind has such a strong need to believe in something superior to itself.
It was very instructive for what was to come.
Go back
Since when have the Daemons been among us?
You've been Mortimer for 600 years? How long have the Daemons been among Mankind?
I don't think I'd be lying if I said that we have always been here.
Speak about certain historical events.
If I follow you, you must have witnessed some of the greatest moments in History.
You could certainly say that, yes.
Ancient Egypt?
Did you know Ancient Egypt?
Oh, yes, yes. We were Gods on earth in those days.
What did Men call you then?
Amenhotep IV.
The...
The tenth pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty?
Oh, I see you're a connoisseur, Louis. Impressive.
Akhenaton?
The Greeks?
Did you know Ancient Greece?
In many ways, yes.
One day Pericles, the next Parmenides.
Just the memory of the time I spent working on acoustics with Pythagoras... Well, it... it moves me quite deeply, to tell the truth.
Pericles? He's the one who brought Athens to its golden age, isn't he?
In a way, yes.
He established democracy, and then died during an epidemic. It wasn't so long after his two sons passed away, isn't that right?
Excuse me Louis, I... I would rather not relive any more of that, if you don't mind.
Ancient Rome?
Did you experience Ancient Rome?
Oh yes. Luxury and decadence, Louis.
My family did indeed reign supreme, but from this period I retain only the works of my friend, Marcus Vitruvius Pollio.
The death of Christ?
You seem to be fascinated by Christ. He...You weren't him, were you?
Oh, no, no. No, not at all.
He was my father, though, strange as it seems.
... I beg your pardon?
Am I dreaming? Please, tell me I'm dreaming!
We shall have a chance to talk about all that again later, but yes, yes, he was my father.
All the mythology surrounding Jesus of Nazareth really stems from my Father's prideful need to show himself among men.
The great Crusades?
I've noticed that you have a passion for the Crusades.
Among other things, yes.
Mainly the third.
It was during the siege of Saint Joan of Arc that I took possession of Lord Mortimer.
And you've never changed "skins" or "bodies" since?
I have used other envelopes but only to carry out very short tasks.
Apart from that, indeed I have been able to retain the identity of William Alexander Mortimer throughout the centuries.
I know enough
Go back
How many of you are there?
The Book of Revelation: "Lucifer, the fallen archangel, left heaven accompanied by 133 306 668 angels."
Is it true that there are that many of you?
No, I assure you, Louis. Forget your Bible class, it's ridiculous.
We are not angels, we don't have wings.
There is certainly nowhere near a million of us and for that matter, no sacred human text represents us correctly.
There are several families and the family to which I belong has 8 siblings, including Gregory and myself.
Sir Gregory is your brother?
Yes... what can I say? You can't choose your family.
But it is very difficult to know exactly how many of us there are because a large number of our kind remain hidden or never reveal themselves even to us.
Do they manipulate thoughts?
And you truly have the power to manipulate the thoughts of Men?
That's right. Every Daemon has the capacity to infiltrate the minds of Men and to read and steer their thoughts.
To what end?
And what do you do with this power?
We help them, of course.
Rubbish!
Of course you do...
And you expect me to believe that, I suppose?
Louis, "Daemon" is just a word.
It all depends on what exists beneath the surface.
I understand that this isn't easy.
The culture of Men is centered on the fact that Daemons are responsible for all the evils on earth.
But if it's the same in every single culture, then maybe there might be something to it, don't you think?
Certainly, there is something to it.
Control. Man has spent his existence wishing to believe in the supernatural, and imposing his belief on others.
What could be more convenient for manipulating the masses?
A perfect inaccessible being and a plethora of Daemons, in every one...
The perfect idea to relieve Men of all responsibility, while still finding them guilty.
What do you mean?
And how is it you help Men exactly?
Let's just say that without us, Man would probably never have left his cave.
Fire, the wheel, tools, writing...
We are the spark that inspires Man to search, to grow, to evolve...
What are these powers exactly?
Can you tell me more about your capacities, your supernatural powers?
Supernatural? From my point of view, they are perfectly natural.
Well Louis, just because the monkey does not fly doesn't mean that we should consider the bird a supernatural creature.
We are all part of a grand design.
We are simply made like this.
By developing our art, we are able to read thoughts as well as write in the minds of Men.
It is possible for us to make them bow to our desire, but it doesn't work without leaving some scars.
Go back
Other questions
How can I believe him?
Why should I trust you?
I'm not asking you to, Louis.
If you are still in doubt about the Daemons, I can assure you that won't last long.
Why tell me all this?
But why me?
Why do I tell you about the greatest secret ever revealed to Man?
It's..
That's right...
I'm coming to that.
Don't worry...
What's happening with my mother?
What has my mother got to do with all this?
She embarked on a crusade, many years ago.
To kill all the Daemons.
How did he react to that?
That must have upset you.
I imagine you retaliated...
No...
I`m afraid she never forgave me.
Forgave what?
We met when she was still just a young woman.
I appeared to her in a different form because I didn't want to reveal the identity of Lord Mortimer at that time.
She was looking for someone interested in the occult to decipher an ancient book.
We spent many years together, until I revealed my true nature to her.
Was it Al Azif?
The old book was Al Azif, wasn't it?
Did she speak about it?
Not so long ago, yes.
Indeed, it was already Al Azif. She wanted to unlock the secrets.
And then?
What happened next?
She felt betrayed, manipulated, tricked.
We had an argument, she rejected me and then she simply disappeared.
Just after that she joined the Order and began to relentlesly hunt us down.
Go back
What are their intentions regarding men?
What are the Daemons` projects for humanity?
Our aim has long since been to protect humanity from itself.
On the other hand, although we give them the impulse to succeed,
we don't all agree as to the path they take to achieve it...
What exactly is a Daemon?
How would you qualify your species, scientifically?
Good question. What is you area of expertise?
Physics
I'd say Physics.
So consider us like the mechanical vibration of fluids.
You mean sound?
That's right. The physical properties of acoustics are very similar to those of our abilities.
Imagine us as something like waves.
Biology
I would say Biology.
So I would class Daemons along with parasites.
The comparison's not very flattering...
You live inside a host and you feed on that host, do you not?
A large number of parasites are essential to the survival of their bearer, you know.
We do indeed choose a host, we enter inside them and we evolve with them.
But if you prefer a more philosophical approach, or a more poetical one, consider us as an idea.
We are an idea that penetrates the human spirit.
But in fact, in no way are we a danger for our hosts. Quite the contrary, we strengthen them.
Philosophy
Given the choice, I'd choose philosophy.
So consider us as an idea, Louis.
We are but a word in the minds of Men. But this word is capable of anything.
Empires have been built on words.
I am not a scientist...
My Lord, to tell you the truth I don't see myself as a scientist.
Well, consider us as a simple species still unknown to most of Men.
Thus we are born. We have the capacity to change bodies, that is all.
Previous questions
Pass...
Continue...
Louis... It's time you opened your eyes.
Come, you'll soon see.
After you.
Why a conference instead of imposing your will upon us?
If you could manipulate us mentally, what's the point of all the theatrics of the conference?
You must suspect that we asked ourselves that very same question.
For many centuries we didn't organize any conferences.
And most of the time it ended in civil war between Daemons. Many of us were killed during this period.
The idea of organizing conferences was the answer to everything.
The interest being to erect some rules among ourselves.
Our family first divided up all the principal countries of the world.
Now whenever one of us wants to propose a major change between these countries, they summon the Daemon in question and initiate a conference.
The Daemon that initiates the proposition doesn't have to give notification of the subject of the conference beforehand, consequently we participate along with our best assets.
Once the humans are brought together, the conference begins but we are forbidden to use our talents to influence the participants.
The first meeting is held in order to expose the subject to all the participants, followed by several days of reflection during which we are allowed to be persuasive but not to impose our will.
A second meeting closes the conference with a final vote.
So... for you it's a game, isn't it?
I understand your remark but after living several centuries, you stand back and enjoy what reflection and pleasure you can...
How do they decide on global policy?
But how do you agree on global policy?
Locally we often have competing interests and sometimes we start wars between Men, which are linked to our disagreements.
Most of the time our Father steps in and gives directives, which my family follow to the letter.
Indeed, in my opinion it is high time we moved on.
What do you mean?
I mean that a new era must begin.
The old monarchic regimes are outdated and it's time to evolve.
Go back
Was von Borchert working for you?
So, von Borchert... He was looking for the Al Azif for you?
Exactly.
Al Azif has always belonged to my family, Louis.
And with good reason, my father wrote much of it.
Can you tell me what you've done with...?
What? You mean, the Al Azif?
No, I already know that: Sarah came here with it and got rid of it...
I was thinking of von Borchert.
He isn't essential but he is a trusted person.
Uh, about him...Uh... How can I put this...?
Ah, I see.
Well, he jumped me, it was him or me...
You don't need to justify yourself, Louis. Don't worry.
He is a prisoner at our headquarters, in Paris.
Alright.
Is there a connection with Elizabeth?
Did what happened to Elizabeth Adams have anything to do with you?
Unfortunately, the poor girl became an issue between us, in spite of herself...
A family of Daemons is still a family, and as in all families, there are disputes.
Elizabeth's family, the Adams, has always been under the patriarchal control of my Father.
As he and myself are not really on very good terms, sending poor Elizabeth here was terribly rude of him, really.
You did accept, though...
No... I would say rather I was presented with the fait accompli by Gregory, and went along with the intention of helping her.
But this is my castle and everyone is the master of their own home.
You controlled her so she would commit suicide!
I knew it!
I know you did. Moreover, you impressed me.
You really did sense what had happened, but you couldn't quite explain how.
A good job too, because for a moment I was afraid you would prove the theory right in front of Gregory.
But why?
Well, she was my Father's eyes and ears and Gregory took a malicious delight in walking her all over the manor to spy on me.
He would be furious if he knew I had prevented Father from being able to check up on what was happening here.
And so...
It was you who killed her!
The child was already condemned, Louis. My Father would never have let her be.
I had to pass inside her mind and, yes, make her take her own life.
Trapped between the unyielding control of my Father and your mother's terrible treatments? I wouldn't wish a life like that on anyone. Would you?
So neither my mother nor Péru were ever guilty?
You just gave me the runaround with that whole investigation.
Now, don't take it the wrong way. I was obliged to keep up appearances so that Gregory wouldn't suspect me.
And it enabled me to size you up, Louis.
So...
The voice in Elizabeth's head, it was you!
It was my Father, to be precise.
So then...
You're the one who killed her!
Yet president Washington told me that Péru was guilty.
George only gave you the official version.
Don't hold it against him. He doesn't know the truth.
The poor girl was condemned, Louis.
Don't you think it better that she stop living like a slave, being mentally raped by my father since the day she was born?
You're not wrong
Maybe you're right.
Certainly not
You're joking!
You don't know everything, she might have recovered from everything she had suffered.
Between the unyielding control of my Father and your mother's terrible treatments, I wouldn't wish a life like that on anyone.
But it is also true, I felt obliged to get rid of her.
You'll understand one day, you'll see.
Go back
Look, I understand everything you say but I actually do have one question, why do you surround yourself with all these servants?
Oh, rest assured, they're not here for you but for me.
They're here to protect me.
Protect you? From whom? Me?
Well, let's just say that you have the Lance and that Sarah has made you believe I'm dangerous.
I would like to avoid any unfortunate mishaps.
But with you being a Daemon, I... I'd have thought you could order me not to attack you.
Naturally, but my aim was to have that happen without resorting to my talent.
Pass...
...
I hope I've answered all your questions, Louis.
Come, I've something to show you...
There... There is one question that remains to be answered...
Why me?
Why tell me all of this?
Oh! Haven't you guessed yet?
Absolutely not.
I really have no idea.
Come on Louis, make an effort.
What do you think could be the reason?
He needs me
I mean, it's obvious you want me on your side, but...
...that doesn't explain why you're telling me all these truths.
Louis, this conference is indeed of capital importance to me.
And yes, I want you on my side.
But that's not the main reason that compels me to confide in you.

I think you sorely need the Golden Order and you want to make sure you've got it.
Really?
You really think I'm that desperate?
Well, I did think so, but now I'm not so sure...
He wants to retrieve the spear
My Lord, I don't know if I can answer in all honesty.
Please do, Louis. You can say anything to me, believe me.
You must admit, being surrounded by all these servants isn't doing much to relax me.
Forget the servants.

However, she hasn't told you everything, Louis.
I can see where he's going with this.
I've got an idea... but it might seem stupid.
Trust me...

I mean, am I a Daemon?
Would you like that?
Yes
I must admit that the idea is appealing.
No
No, I don't think so.
I'm just a Man and that's fine with me.
Look...
We are of the Gods, Louis. Always have been.
You, as much as me...
You are one of us, Louis. You too are a Daemon.
Are you serious?
You know it... Deep down inside, you know I am telling you the truth.
Where do you think that natural charismatic presence comes from?
Your talent must already have manifested itself somehow.

I... What?
I'm sorry you had to find out this way, Louis, but you must know the truth before you commit an irreparable act.
No, I... No...
No, it's not possible...
You are my son...
De Richet!
Sticking your nose everywhere again!
Wow, what's the matter with him?
Excuse me, Monsieur? I don't follow you...
I haven't come all this way just to fail so close to the goal!
Why, what are you talking about?
I am talking about what you are doing!
This conference is going to boost my career!
There is no question of me letting you ruin everything!
I just surprised Piaggi and Wöllner talking. You were about to rob Mortimer!!
Give me what you took from him, immediately...
Let's keep calm, please. I... I don't know what you're talking about...
I'll have to have to cut this short, quick!
Make him see sense
Look, I don't know what you're going on about and I don't have time for this right now.
Hit him
Don't bank on getting rid of me so easily, de Richet!
Where have you been?
I'm looking for my mother
I'm still looking for my mother, if... if you can believe it!
I've been in the manor basement... to check if she might've gotten lost...
And did you find her?
No, not a trace.
I'm warning you, de Richet, I've got my eye on you.
Or else what?
How dare you speak to me in that tone!
Don't play that game with me!
If I find out you are preventing this conference from going ahead smoothly, I will do everything in my power to arrest you!
Are you threatening me?
I got lost in the basement.
I've been in the crypt of the manor.
What the hell were you doing there?
I was visiting and got lost.
I do believe that is the worst lie anyone has ever told me.
You are not even qualified to be here among us!
Trust me
Did Lord Mortimer tell you you could trust me?
Yes but...
So?
I might have disappointed you on the negotiation of your precious cannons, but Lord Mortimer believes I can still be useful.
I'm working for him right now and you're wasting my time with your questions.
I...
Look, if he hasn't taken you into his confidence, then you shouldn't know yet.
I'll soon figure out what you are up to!
And I am convinced that you have indeed robbed Mortimer.
The game is up, give me what you took from him!
You know, this is becoming an obsession with you.
Show me what you are carrying or I will call the servants!!
Give him another rare object
Lodestone
Architect's notes
Golden Elixir
Alright, you win.
Here, this is what I stole from Lord Mortimer.
Sorry if it might have...
You must really take me for a fool!
These things are everywhere in the Manor. I know perfectly well this is not what you are hiding.
I've got one cross left...
Go back
Give him a rare manuscript
Encyclopedia
Very well, fair is fair, you've exposed me!
Here, this is what I took from him!
Look, I'm sorry... I acted on a bizarre impulse.
I don't know either and frankly, you have disappointed me.
That said, it is not as bad as I thought it would be.
Thought of Mortimer
Mysterious notes
Hortus Delicarium
Go back
Get him in a muddle
Remind me, who did you hear making these alleged charges against me?
His eminence Piaggi and Mr von Wöllner were discussing them when I joined them.
And remind me, during the conference, which side were his Eminence and Mr von Wöllner on?
I... Sir Gregory, but what has that got to do with it?
And did it not occur to you for a single instant, that they might have been speaking about me in front of you, on purpose, to manipulate you?
I trust them to detect novices who are likely to be taken in, yes.
Those sons of whores!
Ah, so that's how they see me!
Be careful to make sure the conference keeps on going ahead smoothly, though, please.
It would grieve me to have to report you to Lord Mortimer.
No, no, of course...
I'll make sure those two bastards get what they've got coming!
Give nothing
I don't know what you're talking about.
Very well!
You leave me no choice but to alert Lord Mortimer.
Blast it, I'll never manage to leave this island if he keeps this up...
Wait...
Good Outcome
Right, we'll leave it there.
I'm glad that things have been cleared up...
So, are we finished here?
Indeed we are. I shall leave you.
That's right, go play somewhere else...
See you later, Monsieur.
Come on, I have to hurry up and join my mother at the wharf, now!
Bad Outcome
You leave me no choice...
Come with me...
Mais qu'est-ce... What is this?
Let him take the spear
Hit him
Fail
I knew you were up to something...
You will thank me later for saving you from this serious error!
Damn it! Mother's going to be livid!
Success
Fail
Damn it! Mother's going to be livid!
De Richet!
Sticking your nose everywhere again!
Wow, what's the matter with him?
Excuse me, Monsieur? I don't follow you...
I haven't come all this way just to fail so close to the goal!
Why, what are you talking about?
I am talking about what you are doing!
This conference is going to boost my career!
There is no question of me letting you ruin everything!
I just surprised Piaggi and Wöllner talking. You were about to rob Mortimer!!
Give me what you took from him, immediately...
Let's keep calm, please. I... I don't know what you're talking about...
I'll have to have to cut this short, quick!
Make him see sense
Look, I don't know what you're going on about and I don't have time for this right now.
Knock him out
Don't bank on getting rid of me so easily, de Richet!
Where have you been?
I'm looking for my mother
I'm still looking for my mother, if... if you can believe it!
I've been in the manor basement... to check if she might've gotten lost...
And did you find her?
No, not a trace.
I'm warning you, de Richet, I've got my eye on you.
Or else what?
How dare you speak to me in that tone!
Don't play that game with me!
If I find out you are preventing this conference from going ahead smoothly, I will do everything in my power to arrest you!
Are you threatening me?
I got lost in the basement.
I've been in the crypt of the manor.
What the hell were you doing there?
I was visiting and got lost.
I do believe that is the worst lie anyone has ever told me.
You are not even qualified to be here among us!
MANIPULATION
Did Lord Mortimer tell you you could trust me?
Yes but...
So?
I might have disappointed you on the negotiation of your precious cannons, but Lord Mortimer believes I can still be useful.
I'm working for him right now and you're wasting my time with your questions.
I...
Look, if he hasn't taken you into his confidence, then you shouldn't know yet.
I'll soon figure out what you are up to!
And I am convinced that you have indeed robbed Mortimer.
The game is up, give me what you took from him!
You know, this is becoming an obsession with you.
Show me what you are carrying or I will call the servants!!
Give him another rare object
Lodestone
Architect's notes
Golden Elixir
Alright, you win.
Here, this is what I stole from Lord Mortimer.
Sorry if it might have...
You must really take me for a fool!
These things are everywhere in the Manor. I know perfectly well this is not what you are hiding.
I've got one cross left...
Go back
Give him a rare manuscript
Encyclopedia
Very well, fair is fair, you've exposed me!
Here, this is what I took from him!
Look, I'm sorry... I acted on a bizarre impulse.
I don't know either and frankly, you have disappointed me.
That said, it is not as bad as I thought it would be.
Thought of Mortimer
Mysterious notes
Hortus Delicarium
Go back
Get him in a muddle
Remind me, who did you hear making these alleged charges against me?
His eminence Piaggi and Mr von Wöllner were discussing them when I joined them.
And remind me, during the conference, which side were his Eminence and Mr von Wöllner on?
I... Sir Gregory, but what has that got to do with it?
And did it not occur to you for a single instant, that they might have been speaking about me in front of you, on purpose, to manipulate you?
I trust them to detect novices who are likely to be taken in, yes.
Those sons of whores!
Ah, so that's how they see me!
Be careful to make sure the conference keeps on going ahead smoothly, though, please.
It would grieve me to have to report you to Lord Mortimer.
No, no, of course...
I'll make sure those two bastards get what they've got coming!
Give nothing
I don't know what you're talking about.
Very well!
You leave me no choice but to alert Lord Mortimer.
Blast it, I'll never manage to leave this island if he keeps this up...
Wait...
Good Outcome
Right, we'll leave it there.
I'm glad that things have been cleared up...
So, are we finished here?
Indeed we are. I shall leave you.
That's right, go play somewhere else...
See you later, Monsieur.
Come on, I have to hurry up and join my mother at the wharf, now!
Bad Outcome
You leave me no choice...
Come with me...
What is going on?
Let him take the spear
Hit him
Fail
I knew you were up to something...
You will thank me later for saving you from this serious error!
Damn it! Mother's going to be livid!
Success
Fail
Damn it! Mother's going to be livid!
I'd better get over to the wharf,
no point risking another confrontation.
I'd better get over to the wharf,
no point risking another confrontation.
Liar!
Well, well. So now you're his bastard!
You really took me for a fool!
Don't make a move, you clowns!
Everybody keep calm!
Don't say a word or I'll shoot your kid!
Ah, not so clever now, are we! At last I've found a way to put the pressure on you, Mortimer!
Look... Just calm down, Monsieur.
Looks like you've lost something, eh? I sure hope it hurt when you lost your godamned hand!
You deserve what happened to you! You're just like him!
No, wait, that's not...
You stopped me from ending it all! Because of you I've had to pay for it!
You don't know what it's like to feel him inside, deep in your soul!!
I never want to feel that again!!
Jacques, I did not betray you.
YOU ARE JUST LIKE HIM!!
I'm not like Mortimer
Jacques, I've only just found out that I'm his son.
You can't hold that against me!
You don't understand! You are already in his clutches!
Everything was set up to bring you here and reveal the secret of your birth to you!!
Open your goddamned eyes!
You've always been under his thumb!!
He has to let me help him
Monsieur, you don't know the whole story, you ought to let me help you.
One more move and I'll burn you down, you bastard!
Jacques, you'll end up hurting yourself if you continue like this...
There's no one to save here, anyway!
Mortimer is lying
Come on, don't tell me you believe all that crap, do you?
Pull yourself together man! There's nothing to prove that anything he told us is true!
You don't know him, Louis...
That's how he operates.
When you start to understand the situation, it'll be too late!! You'll already be in up to the neck!
I'd also like to know what's happening
Monsieur Péru, I don't even know what this is all about...
It's quite simple, you are like them!
If that's enough to make me unforgivably evil, then I'd prefer you shoot...
But I don't feel as if I've changed, I'm... I'm still the same man I was an hour ago!
They will corrupt you, it's inevitable!
And I won't be able to resist, like you are now?
Well...
Give me the benefit of the doubt... Think about it a moment...
How can that human dare to threaten me?
How dare you threaten me then?!
So that's it, is it? You've gone over to his side, have you?
It didn't take you too long, did it...
So?... what are you going to do now?
You've just found out your true nature!
What difference does it make?
I don't know, I haven't thought about it
What do you want me to tell you, honestly?
I've only just found out myself and here you are threatening me with a weapon.
Just give me a moment...
No! That's just the point, you are out of time!
You ought to ask yourself that question, Louis... Wake up!
Nothing, I'm still the same
Wait, Jacques!
If it weren't for me, you... you'd be dead by now! You've seen who I am and this so-called revelation makes no difference!
I'm not a slave to my birth! And I refuse to pretend to be a victim!
I AM LOUIS DE RICHET!
Do you really believe you've got enough strength to resist him?
I am who I am. Only our actions truly define us!
And you can threaten me all you want, it won't make any difference!
Don't change, Louis. You are strong...
I wasn't able to make it...
Make him believe that you already knew that it won't make any difference
Jacques, I can assure you that what Lord Mortimer just told me makes no difference.
That's what you think... but you are already in his hands, and you don't even know it, Louis.
No, Jacques, it's the contrary.
Everything that's been happening here has been carefully planned by the Golden Order for months, and everything is going exactly as planned.
Lower your weapon. It's alright. It's over, you'll make it through. And you're going get your life back.
And what difference does it make to him?
And you, Jacques! How does it make you feel?
It changes everything.
Why?
How am I responsible for it?
But I never said your were.
You too are his victim, Louis, but it makes no difference to me. If I let you go, you will proliferate.
I must stop all of you, and too bad for me if I have to die for it!
You are just like him...
You are already. You can't see it, or you don't want to see it, but it's already too late.
In fact, I haven't got any choice.
You always have a choice.
You know very well what will happen to you if you shoot me.
If he shoots me, there'll be no one to stop Mortimer
Jacques, I'm the only one who can help you resolve the situation.
I'm just asking you to trust me.
I'm not against you.
Your daughter will grow up without a father
You're going to be held accountable... and you will lose everything!
Starting with your freedom, and then your head.
I told you, I don't care!
Not about yourself, maybe... But what about your daughter? It wouldn't be the same for her, would it?
Shut up... shut up!
She will be alone, in a world that you know is hostile.
What will become of her?
I... that's true, but...
Don't abandon her... Not a second time.
It's your last chance, my friend.
He doesn't know Mortimer very well, in fact
You should trust him just a little bit.
If you knew him better, you would see he has a true vision for the future of France.
Can you hear yourself speak?
I know his damn vision! Every time he violated my soul, I had lots of time to see it, his vision for the future of Men!
I would be a good Daemon
If I am indeed a Daemon now, as Lord Mortimer claims, then I have always been one, Jacques.
The fact of finding it out today makes no difference to my personality.
You can't choose your parents.
Daemons will always exist
And between you and me, I'm not as important as you think.
If you shoot me, it won't change a thing for the other Daemons, now, will it?
It'll be one less!
And he wants you! For the first time I can stop what he wants.
Good Outcome
It's over... come now, Monsieur.
You know what I told you...
Evil and Good depend on you, and not on your nature.
Yes, it's true... and the same holds true for all of us.
Monsieur Péru, I am willing to overlook this latest scene.
You can thank my son for that.
I think, however, that you ought to take your leave, for your good and ours.. as well as that of your daughter.
Bad Outcome
You should never have come here!
You are just like him and you all deserve to die!
Stop!
Louis, you ought to learn not to walk into danger.
Fear not, I've blocked him. He can't move.
One more second and he would have shot you.
You wanted to save him during the conference, so it's up to you to decide his fate.
Does he still deserve your mercy or have you had enough? I'll let you choose.
Have Mortimer get him to commit suicide
No, he's yours.
Go ahead, do it...
Don't blame yourself, Louis.
You did your best to help him but he was already lost...
Take the body away and clean the Hall.
Send him back to his room
But there's still good inside him.
Make him leave the island immediately
Make him leave.
Louis! Do you realize that will mean one less vote at the conference?
I thought you said you'd let me choose!
Very well, Louis.
He will be gone within the hour.
Make him forget everything
Free him. Let him think that he just came here for the conference and that he will serve you with devotion.
Fine. But are you acting out of compassion or vengeance?
Compassion
Compassion.
Vengeance
It's out of the question! We can't let this swine get away with it.
There, it's done.
I really thought my next breath would be my last.
Well, anything's possible...
This is no time to be joking.
Just help me climb aboard this boat and let's get off of this cursed island.
No.
I'm not going anywhere, and neither are you, until you've told me everything.
For crying out loud, what are you talking about?
MIND READER
No, no, no! Not now, no! Make him not want to know!!
Mortimer is my father
Why have you never told me he's my Father?
Paris, 1763
Paris, 1763. Number 12, on rue des Martyrs.
Tell her you know
I know everything.
No...
I beg you, please trust me.
He's manipulating you... we must leave.
Paris.
Can't you see he wants you and he'll do anything to turn you against me...?
Number 12, on rue des Martyrs...
He had to pay for what he did to me!
I panicked! There she was, with the baby due. I thought it was the right time to touch it but when...
To touch it?
By disemboweling her and stealing me from her?
The girl was already condemned to die. He never leaves any witnesses behind. She meant nothing to him.
And I absolutely had to find a way of stopping him.
MIND READER
I couldn't let him reproduce! I had to stop him propagating himself!
By stealing a baby?
Had you lost your mind or what?
How did you stop him by stealing a baby?
He was multiplying...
I had to do something! It took me years to pick up his trail again, Louis!
She stole my life from me!
You stole my life from me!
No, Louis. I gave you a life.
I offered you a choice! You got to know humanity. You are more human than many of us.
All you wanted was to wound him
You snatched a new born baby from its mother's womb, with the sole goal of seeking revenge!
From the second I took you in, I couldn't bear to be apart from you.
I looked after you, fed you, raised you, like a mother.
MIND READER
I am your mother.
She manipulated me.
You made me in your own image.
No, you're wrong!
It's true, you raised me.
I know...
You always took care of me.
I devoted my whole life to teaching you to distinguish between right and wrong.
So you would have the choice.
You are not like him!
B... but... but you never told me!
I wanted to.
I very nearly told you everything at least a dozen times.
You didn't, though. Did you?
Why?
I... I don't know, Louis...
MIND READER
I couldn't...
Not after Venice...
Lack of courage
You lacked the courage.
Yes, Louis.
Yes, I was wrong. I should have told you earlier!
I know! Forgive me! I beg you...
She would never have told me the truth
You never would have dared to tell me everything.
Yes!
I would have told you everything! I swear! But it wasn't easy, I wanted to choose the right time...
Venice!
Talk to me about Venice.
Oh no... I....
Louis, let's go. I'll tell you everything once we get home.
Now come!
You never wanted us to speak about it again.
Winter 1791, do you remember?
Louis, no. We agreed to never speak about it again.
Now I understand.
Drop it, Louis!
Venice, talk to me about Venice
We were on the trail of a businessman. We broke into his place, one night.
We ran into his wife...
Not that, Louis. It's in the past.
She too was pregnant.
Was he Mortimer's as well?
Louis, I...
Answer!
Yes.
Don't go there, Louis!
What did she do with the child?
What became of the child?
I gave it away.
For him too, you became his mother, didn't you?
No! I gave him to a couple who couldn't have children! I never saw him again!
How many children have you stolen from him?
I saved all of you, Louis.
I gave you a normal life!
MIND READER
Nine...
How many of us are there?
How many?
There are two of you.
I don't want to know.
Fear?
It was easier not to face up to it. Not to stir it all up.
Don't judge me, Louis.
You were afraid of my reaction
I wanted to tell you everything once you were old enough to understand.
Forgive me...
Louis, yes, I made mistakes in the past.
But now I'm ready to...
Do you consider me a mistake?
No, not you! You are what I am most proud of in my whole life!
You are good! You fight to do right! You are not like him!
Still, he is my Father!
Why did you steal me!
You don't want to know! Believe me!!
For once in your life be honest!
Why all this mess? Why do you have it in for him so much?
Why?
Because I'm his daughter!
I know what he's doing.
I see he has his eye on you. He's hovering around you, tempting you. He did it to me before you.
And if you don't live up to his expectations, he will cast you away.
Is that what happened to you?
I wasn't good enough for him so he rejected me.
What do you mean?
He tried to initiate me but it would seem I am unable to develop his talent. I can't withdraw my mind from my body.
I get it. The reason why you abducted me is because he didn't love you, isn't it?
He doesn't love anyone, Louis. Don't be taken in.
I forgive her
You are my mother.
Whatever you've done, I can't take that away from you.
It doesn't excuse everything, but in time we will find a way of putting it all behind us.
Oh ! Thank you, Louis.
Thank you! I will never lie to you again!
Come on, let's go.
No, Mother.
I'm not going back with you, I can't.
What do you mean? Louis, you can't stay here! He will...
Don't worry about me.
I have to stay. I still have a lot to learn.
But you go.
Louis...
I'll see you in Paris, don't worry.
Give her Piaggi's letter and her bag.
Here, this is yours...
Give her Piaggi's letter
Here, this is yours.
Give her back her bag
Here, take this. This is yours.
Keep everything
Don't forget, Louis. You've got the Lance. You can beat him!
If you hit him with it, he won't be able to escape from his mortal envelope and he will die with it.
I never want to see her again
You are going to take that boat and return to France.
I never want to see you again.
Louis, no! Don't say that!
Not after everything I've done for you!! You have no right...
MIND READER
You are mine!
You will never be free! I will find you and you will fall back into line! Like all your brothers and sisters.
Until you're ready to take him on!
Kill her!
Let her leave
Say farewell to her.
Farewell, Mother. Take care of yourself.
Drop dead
You're not my mother!!
You're crazy, woman!! I'll never be yours!!
You're not my mother!!
In spite of everything, she was right.
I'm a little mixed up... but I do understand your choice.
You were wrong not to speak to me about it before.
But I understand that you didn't want to leave me with him.
Oh thank you, Louis!
I promise never to lie to you again, my son.
Come, let's go home...
I can't.
What do you mean? Why not?
I've got to know.
Trust me.
We'll meet in Paris.
He wants you, Louis! He will never let you go!
Don't worry.
I really thought my next breath would be my last.
Well, anything's possible...
This is no time to be joking.

Come, let's go home...
I can't.
What do you mean? Why not?
I've got to know.
Trust me.
We'll meet in Paris.
He wants you, Louis! He will never let you go!
Don't worry.
Excuse me, Monsieur, Lord Mortimer is asking for you.
Excuse me, Monsieur, we cannot let you pass.
Emily...
What are you doing here?
You wouldn't have seen...
Mother!
No!
No! What's happened?
No, Mother! No!!
She's ruined my life, Louis.
I am sorry...
What were you thinking?
Emma meant everything to me.
Your mother destroyed everything by shooting her.
She was me and I was her!
MIND READER
Dear God, I beg you, make him kill me...
I've had enough of it all... I no longer have the strength in me...
I HAD TO SPEAK TO HER!!
I NEEDED TO TALK TO HER!!
She was going to tell me everything!!
I am sorry...
I did what Emma would have done.
But Sarah's not the one who killed Emma!
You're the one who killed Emma! Not my mother!!
And it wouldn't have happened if Sarah hadn't struck out at Emma first!
Kill her!
She was going to tell me everything!!
Get her out of my sight
Get out of here...
Why have you always lied to me?...
...
Why didn't you ever tell me I was his son?...
Emily...
What are you doing here?
You wouldn't have seen...
Mother!
No!
No! What's happened?
No, Mother! No!!
She's ruined my life, Louis.
I am sorry...
What were you thinking?
Emma meant everything to me.
Your mother destroyed everything by shooting her.
She was me and I was her!
MIND READER
Dear God, I beg you, make him kill me...
I've had enough of it all... I no longer have the strength in me...
I HAD TO SPEAK TO HER!!
I NEEDED TO TALK TO HER!!
She was going to tell me everything!!
I am sorry...
I did what Emma would have done.
But Sarah's not the one who killed Emma!
You're the one who killed Emma! Not my mother!!
And it wouldn't have happened if Sarah hadn't struck out at Emma first!
Kill her!
She was going to tell me everything!!
Get her out of my sight
Get out of here...
Why have you always lied to me?...
...
Why didn't you ever tell me I was his son?...
Oh, no, NO! Mother!
Louis!
It was accident, I'm sorry...
I didn't have a choice, she attacked me...
I... I didn't want to hurt her...
What happened?
I was on the wharf, it was dark,
She seemed to be preparing to depart.
I moved closer, I wanted us to talk but as soon as she saw me, she threatened me...
I wanted her to explain to me in her own words, what had happened to Emma.
I had to know what happened, Louis. You understand that, don't you?
MINDREADER
Is it really for him that you left me, Emily?
That's pathetic! Look, he still doesn't get it, for crying out loud...
Emma...
Oh, the bitch...
I want to be alone.
I'd like to be alone...
Please...
Right.
I'll leave you.
Kill her!
What did she say to you?
Did she say anything before she died?
I didn't understand everything, she was in a blind rage.
She pointed her pistol at me...
She spoke to me as if I were you and called me Louis.
She said you look so much like her and that she was so proud to have a son like you.
Did my mother say how proud she was to have me for a son?
That's right.
She's lying!
My mother would have never said that!
You're lying!!
Why, he does have a spine...!
So, Sarah couldn't be proud of her beloved son, huh? How in heavens would I know?
You're not Emily...
Surprise, little Louis!
It took you long enough, though!
Yes, you got it wrong... You didn't choose the right one!
She got even!
You wanted to get even for Emma's death!
You killed her! Admit it!!
Louis, stop, I swear that's what happened...
You are frightening me...
That's enough! Get out of here, Emily!
I never want to see you again!!
What exactly happened?
Tell me exactly what happened!
I told you.
I was on the other side of the wharf when she arrived. I wanted to get closer.
She was muttering to herself.
She was hurling abuse at Lord Mortimer.
When she saw me, she pulled out a pistol and pointed it at me.
I'm so sorry...
I'd like to be alone.
Of course.
I'm going up to the manor.
Emma!
You bitch!
What?
Louis, what's wrong with y...
No!!!
You are not Emily!!
Ah... that?
It took you long enough to figure it out, though.
I felt sorry for you when I saw you couldn't even recognize her, Louis.
What do you expect? It wasn't my fault.
Yes, you spent a night with her. She can't have made much of an impression on you.
Ah, men!
Shut it!
Was it perhaps that night we spent together after the conference that persuaded you that I was worth more than her?
I... What?...
Oh... You still don't get it...
The night of the conference...
It wasn't poor Emily who paid you a little visit in your room. Oh, she was much too busy with Monsieur Bonaparte.
No, that's not true...
It was me, of course.
I assure you, you got something a whole lot better.
And when I think she wasn't even armed when I arrived.
Right! Take a moment to think and meet me at the Manor, later.
You're crazy!
Now, now, Louis! Don't push it!
I understand your grief, but I won't put up with that sort of talk from you, or anybody.
MIND READER
If he says one more word, I won't be around to satisfy any of his desires!
Die!
Wait, madame...
She's crazy...
But I... you've lost your mind...
That's enough!
That's not how you talk to a lady!
Let her go!
I'd like to be alone, Madame.
That's alright. I'd rather that, too.
See you later, Louis.
Strangle the crazy woman!
She's stark raving mad...
Die, you bitch!
Oh, no, NO! Mother!
Louis!
