The Holy Lance! Luckily, Napoleon couldn't put it back in its place
You again?
Who's there?
Elizabeth? But... I saw your body! You're dead!
Elizabeth? But you left!
Gregory?
No... No, you are not Gregory...
Something's not right... Gregory, you are in danger...
Elizabeth... What's the matter?
WHO ARE YOU?
Introduce yourself
My name is Louis de Richet!
Sarah de Richet's son
Sarah de Richet's son!
Sarah... I know someone called Sarah...
An impure... a spawn of William's...
No, you cannot be her son... She couldn't have children...
William Mortimer's son
William Alexander Mortimer's son!
William?!
Ah... I see...
Don't tell him who you are!
There's no point in getting rough.
If you have a question, just ask me!
Empty words!
You refuse to tell me who you are... But I will find you out...
No one can escape me...
Say nothing
Make yourself very small, Louis...
It's useless trying to hide!
I will find you...
Go away, Louis!
Don't stay here, Louis...
What's happening here?
My son is in danger...
Talk!
Talk about him
MIND READ
Who is he?
Whom do I have the honor of addressing?
You are just a fool, a mere child...
I have no time to waste with you...
Dammit, who is that now?
What kind of creature are you...?
Creature?... Is that what you call me?
Be careful, your audacity might cost you dearly.
Let's try to find out who I am speaking to...
Sir, rest assured, I have no quarrel with you.
With all due respect, would you mind telling me to whom I am speaking, please?
I would not like to make a blunder.
I see you're trying to be civil.
I accept your ignorance and agree to answer you.
I am the Father of all, founder of our house, grand architect of the laws that govern us and creator of he you call...
Gregory Holm, at this moment, yes, as well as all of his brothers and sisters.
Damn it, it's Holm and Mortimer's father...
But why am I hearing you through Elizabeth Adams?
So that is how you see me, is it?
Here, everything is mere make-believe.
Your mind is working to give me an appearance that will allow you to see me...
He is the voice that Elizabeth kept hearing!
You're the one who Elizabeth kept hearing in her head!
You're the one who gnawed at her from inside, year after year!
Who dares speak to me in that tone of voice?
She spent her whole life trying to escape from you!
And it was all for nothing!
No one can escape from me!
Go back
Speak about Elizabeth
MIND READING
I thought Elizabeth was alive
Is Elizabeth still alive?
She is...
Was it you who prompted her to leave?
Yes
Yes, she felt...
What gives you the right?
I didn't mean any harm...
Young fool!
She allowed me to find out what was going on with my sons...
Stop interfering in my business!
No
No, I haven't the...
Lies! Lies! I sense you are lying...
You have spoken to her...
You have been talking together...
I see... wine... yes...
Concentrate, Louis, he's reading your thoughts!
Sarah... You are thinking about that poor Sarah...
She spoke to you about voices. Elizabeth spoke to you about me...
And you didn't believe her
And you believed her...
I thought Elizabeth was dead
I thought you were dead!
I am not Elizabeth Adams...
She was killed... brutally...
Who killed her? Tell me!
Tell him you don't know
I haven't the faintest idea...
Very well.
You're lying!
You know, don't you. Why hide the truth from me?
Are you the one...?
No! No, it's not you... But you know who did it...
One last time...
Who killed Elizabeth Adams?
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Don't mention Mortimer
Listen, I don't...
William!!!
It's William!
Ah! I'm sure it is...
But I... I didn't say anything...
No need...
Don't think about anything
Concentrate...
Ah, you resist...this is almost...charming...
Shall I show you what true conviction is?
WHO KILLED ELIZABETH ADAMS?
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him
It's just... I don't... William...
That is good, my child.
Say nothing
Shut up, Louis...
That's none of my business...
Oh? You would rather say nothing, would you?
Fine... Never mind...
Tell him it's Mortimer
I think Lord Mortimer is the one who is responsible for all of this...
It was to be expected...
I didn't think he would dare to...
But he did!
Is it he who possessed Elizabeth?
Is it you who...
Your question is irrelevant..
Elizabeth was just a receptacle which allowed me to observe William's actions.
But I... I didn't even ask the question!
You thought it...
What did he do to Elizabeth?
But tell me, what happened with Eliz...
That's enough!
Do you think you can question me?
Do you really have no idea who I am?
Go back
Talk about the situation
MIND READING
Tell him that you are for Mortimer
I'm one of Lord Mortimer's allies.
I'm here for the conference.
Yes, I see that you're telling the truth.
Is the conference over?
Yes. But I don't think that's important anymore...
Gregory!
What happened?
Well, apparently...
Speak!
Mortimer, he... he poisoned him!
AH! BETRAYAL!
He dared break the rules! He will be tracked down and punished for this!
Liar!
I see you helped my son Gregory!
And you did well.
However, just remember one thing... Lie to me again and it will cost you dearly...
Tell him that you are for Holm
I'm one of the guests of the conference, an ally of Sir Gregory.
You are telling the truth.
Is the conference over?
Yes.
Not only did Lord Mortimer win the vote, it seems he also planned to get rid of Sir Gregory by poisoning him.
Sir Gregory won the vote but it seems that Lord Mortimer hadn't planned on him winning and poisoned him...
What?! How vile!!
Gregory came on my approval! How dare Mortimer attack his own brother!
He will pay for this!
Liar!
I see that you serve the interests of William!
I see...
Gregory! You poisoned him!
It wasn't me, I haven't done anything...
Scoundrel! How dare you!
I assure you, I knew nothing about it!
Ah! Now you're telling the truth...
William! I should never have trusted you at all!
You will pay!
Holm is going to die
Sir Gregory has been poisoned...
What?!!
Who dares attack my son?
It would seem it was Lord Mortimer...
William! That vile little traitor!
He dared overstep our family rules!
"No member of the family will you kill!"
The dog! He will pay for this!
Go back

Leave 
Emily?
Louis... Louis!
Who on earth is...
Louis, where are you? I can't see you!!
In front of you, Emily...
She can't see me...
Louis, are you dead too?!
It's complicated...
I thought Emma killed you....
Ah, yes, that's right... She still doesn't know everything I've found out...
Emma is dead
Emily... I have to tell you that Emma is dead....
I... Well...
Justice has been done!
Emma has gone mad
After her crime... Emma descended into madness.
You... Are you insinuating that she wasn't responsible for her actions?
It is probable...
Apologize for getting them mixed up
I feel responsible for what happened to you, Emily...
I made a mistake...
I've been thinking it over... No one forced her, Louis!
She would have ended up doing it in another place, another time... But she still would have done it!
It bears no importance here
I understand that it must be difficult to forgive her, but if you think about it...
Salvation won't be found in anger, Emily.
It's all so unfair, Louis!
A part of me does understand her actions...
To hell with good intentions!
On the contrary, I believe now is the perfect time to decide how you want to live your life.
In bitterness or in peace?
Think about it, Emily...
Say nothing
...
But... I thought...
How is it that you are here?
Can you move around?
I can't explain...
Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to explain what's happening to us, Emily.
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you are...
But you can move around...
Maybe because I'm not dead?
Explain to her about the Daemons and the Ether
I'm going to have to be a bit blunt here, Emily.
You'll have to excuse me but it's quite baffling...
Mortimer and Holm are age-old spirits who can change bodies.
I... What?!
They're Daemons...
Louis, are you feeling alright?
And I am one too.
Louis, you don't seem very well at all...
Because William Mortimer is my father.
And he's yours too, yours and Emma's.
He's bestowed certain powers on me, like how to read a human mind, and even how to control it...
Look, I know... It's a lot to take in.
Are you alright?
Yes... Actually, no, how do you expect me to feel?
It would be easier if you told me you'd simply lost your mind, or even that I've lost my mind, which would at least make some sense...
If only something inside me didn't vibrate at the sound of your words...
I'm not making it up, Emily. You've got to believe me...
And where are we then?
In the Ether, I think.
Think of it as a psychic dimension...
Oh. Well, that explains it, then....
Do you have anymore bedtime stories like that?
Well... you are dead.
Yes... of course I am.
I should have known. Ask a stupid question...
Yes, I know, Emily. It's... it's hard to believe but even if it seems insane, I... I assure you that it's all true.
We are dead and we're talking in the Ether.
Well... Not exactly. You see I'm not dead.
What? But...
If you are here without being dead... Then there must be a way out!
Help me, Louis!
I am begging you, help me!
Let's help her!
I'll do everything I can to find a solution.
You... You promise?
Yes, trust me!
I can't promise anything...
I'd... I'd rather be honest, Emily...
I'm not going to make any false promises here.
But...
Louis, please!
I'm sorry.
You can say that because you're not the one who's stuck here!
Adieu, Emily... Adieu...
No! No, don't abandon me! Louis!
Reassure her
Clearly it seems like there must be some way of getting you out of here...
So technically, yes, I don't see what could stop you...
Do you really think so?
Oh nothing much surprises me now!
I must go...
Wait! Wait, don't leave me! For pity's sake, Louis!
But I must, if I'm... I'm to find a solution...
Be brave, Emily!
Yes, I understand...
I trust you...
I'll be back for you, I promise.
Emily?
Louis...
Who on earth is...
Louis, where are you? I can't see you!!
In front of you, Emily...
She can't see me...

I... yes, I understand...
I trust you...
I'll be back.
... My own sister!
I should have left her to die when the Tsarina caught her!
I really am so stupid!
It was obvious that she would betray me one day!
That bitch!
Louis!
Help!!
Don't leave me!!
Louis?
LOUIS!!!
Come back!!
Emily?
Louis...
You were reciting something?
A prayer of atonement.
It's my punishment, Louis. For what I did to Emma.
And for what I did to Sarah...
I must do penance for all my sins...
No, you are mistaken...
It's... it's a lot more complex than that...
You're in the Ether and...
It's well deserved!
What exactly were you hoping for, after everything that's happened?
You're going to be able to think about all the things you've done, Emily!
I am dead, Louis!
I am stuck at the place of my death, and I can't seem to move.
And I'm talking to an apparition that represents precisely why I lost my mind...
The one for whom I committed the unforgivable!
Emily, listen to me, I assure you...
No.
No, that's enough... I can't bear it anymore!
Even in death, I have to pay for my errors...isn't being dead payment enough!?
I am damned, leave me alone, demons!
I don't want to listen to you anymore!
Off with you, Satan!!!
Leave her, Louis. There's nothing you can do for her...
Very well, Emily. Very well...
Emily?
Louis...
I wasn't expecting anybody... let alone you.
Me neither, actually...
You were reciting...
A prayer of atonement.
I must pay for my sins, Louis. I finally understand!
It's my punishment, Louis. For my act against Emma.
And for what I did to Sarah...
I must do penance for all my sins...
No, you are mistaken...
It's a lot more complex than that...
You are in the Ether and...
It's well deserved!
What exactly were you hoping for, after everything that has happened?
You are going to be able to think about all the things you've done, Emily!
I am dead, Louis!
I am stuck at the place of my death, and I can't seem to move.
And I'm talking to an apparition that represents precisely why I lost my mind...
The one for whom I committed the unforgivable!
Emily, listen to me, I assure you...
No
No, that's enough... I can't bear it anymore!
Even in death, I have to pay for my errors...isn't being dead payment enough!?
I am damned, leave me alone, demons!
I don't want to listen to you anymore!
Off with you, Satan!!!
Leave her, Louis. There's nothing you can do for her...
Very well, Emily.
Mindful, alas! That we ourselves
Have had a share
In such great indignities,
Which we now deplore from the depths of our hearts,
We humbly
Ask your pardon
And declare our readiness
To atone by voluntary expiation,
Not only for our own personal offenses,
But also for the sins of those,
Who, straying far from the path of salvation,
Refuse in their obstinate infidelity
To follow you,
Their Shepherd and Leader
Or, renouncing the vows of their baptism,
Have cast off the sweet yoke of your law.
In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
I confess, my God...
I have sinned!
Away from me, Satan!
Never again will I heed your words!
In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
Good god, I can't even move... But Louis can.
What's happening?
What? What are you doing here?
Emma?
YOU!
It wasn't enough for you to let me be killed!
You have to come here and start babbling away at me!?
Fool! You couldn't have stopped her from shooting, could you!
Emily surprised me
I'm sorry, Emma, it... it all happened too fast.
I... I didn't believe for an instant that... that Emily would shoot.
Of course! How could poor Emily ever have a wicked thought?!
No, she's so sweet and innocent!  Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth!
Emily? I killed her...
What?!
She shot my mother and so I killed her.
I couldn't guess she would shoot...
Oh! Don't sass me!
You can change your tone because I'm not the one who shot at you, remember!
It's not my fault if your sister got rid of you like a dead weight!
I...
What you just said was nasty...
That was for treating me like an idiot.
I didn't want it to happen like that...
I just wanted to exist a little, too.
Didn't you ever think there might be other ways of doing that?
Obviously, it's easy to say that now.
It's her fault
Wait, Emma!
You're the one who passed yourself off as Emily.
You decided you wanted to play with us.
You pushed your sister to the edge and now this is the result!
It's got nothing to do with me!
I only wanted to exist for one, brief moment!
Spending my life in her shadow, being her double...it wasn't enough!
I must have taken up too much room again!
That's not what I said...
Only appearing to carry out the basest of chores! How ungrateful of me to want to exist! To make my own choices!
It suits you to think that it's all my fault... Be that as it may...
Louis, we have no time to lose.
Help me, please...
What on earth is she talking about?
Come on... I...
You're dead...
No! There's got to be a solution!
I am made of the same stuff as you! I already survived a gunshot at point blank range!
I will survive this!
Help me! I'll go mad if I stay here any longer!
... it's only been a few days...
What? Are you joking?!
I must have been here several months! I... I stopped counting from...
Hang on...
What are you doing here?
Are you dead?
Too bad for her! Leave her!
I don't have time to argue with you.
No, wait!
Don't leave me here!
There's nothing I can do for you, Emma.
You're dead...
No, but...
Good luck, Emma...
Explain to her
No, Sir Gregory brought my spirit here but I must get back as soon as possible.
It would take too long to explain
Look, never mind.
Don't take this the wrong way, but it would take too long to explain it all.
But you can move about, can't you?
I'm not dead, Emma.
So you should be able to help me!
No
I don't think there's anything I can do, Emma.
Good luck.
No, wait, don't leave me!...
Come back!!
I don't know
Emma, I have no idea of what's going on.
How do you expect me to help you?
There must be a way!
I beg you! Promise you will help me, Louis!
Promise to help her
Alright, alright, calm down.
I'll do everything I can to get you out of here.
Thank you, Louis!
I knew you were a good man!
Right, I must get going now.
Just stay calm, everything will work out fine!
Promise nothing
Emma, how can you expect me to promise anything under these conditions?
Don't leave me, Louis!
Look, I don't want to get your hopes up, Emma.
I hope you understand...
Farewell
No, Louis!! NO!!
She got what she deserved
Maybe...
Don't count on it.
I... What??
You deserve what's coming to you, Emma, so don't count on me helping you!
No, Louis, you...
Farewell...
YOU!
It wasn't enough for you to let me be killed!
You have to come here and start babbling away at me!?
Emma?
But... what are you doing there?
Fool! You couldn't have stopped her from shooting, could you!
Emily surprised me
I'm sorry, Emma, it was all too quick.
I didn't believe for an instant that Emily would shoot.
Of course! How could poor Emily ever have a wicked thought?!
No, she's so sweet and innocent!  Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth!
I killed her...
I... What?!
She shot my mother and so I killed her.
I couldn't guess she would shoot...
Oh! Don't sass me!
You can change your tone because I'm not the one who shot at you, remember!
It's not my fault if your sister got rid of you like a dead weight!
I...
What you just said was nasty...
That was for treating me for an idiot.
I didn't want it to happen like that...
I just wanted to exist a little, too.
Did you ever think there might other ways to do that?
Obviously, it's easy to say that now.
It's her fault
Wait, Emma!
You're the one who passed yourself off as Emily.
You decided you wanted to play with us.
You pushed your sister to the edge and now this is the result!
It's got nothing to do with me!
I only wanted to exist for one, brief moment!
Spending my life in her shadow, being her double...it wasn't enough!
I must have taken up too much room again!
That's not what I said...
Only coming out for the basest of chores! How ungrateful of me to want to exist! To make my own choices!
It suits you to think that it's all my fault... But that is as it may be...
Louis, we have no time to lose.
Help me, please...
What on earth is she talking about?
Come on... I...
You are dead...
No! There's got to be a solution!
I am made of the same stuff as you! I already survived a gunshot at point blank range!
I will survive this!
Help me! I'll go mad if I stay here any longer!
...it's only been a few days...
I... What? Are you joking?!
I must have been here several months! I stopped counting from...
Hang on...
What are you doing here?
Are you dead?
Too bad for her! Leave her!
I don't have time to argue with you.
No, wait!
Don't leave me here!
There's nothing I can do for you, Emma.
You are dead...
No, but...
Good luck, Emma...
Explain to her
No, Sir Gregory brought my spirit here but I must get back as soon as possible.
It would take too long to explain
Look, never mind.
Don't take this the wrong way, but it would take too long to explain it all.
But you can move about, can't you?
I'm not dead, Emma.
So you should be able to help me!
No
I don't think there's anything I can do, Emma.
Good luck.
No, wait, don't leave me!...
Come back!!
I don't know
Emma, I have no idea of what's going on.
How do you expect me to help you?
There must be a way!
I beg you! Promise you will help me, Louis!
Promise to help her
Alright, calm down.
I'll do all I can to get you out of here.
Thank you, Louis!
I knew you were a good man!
Right, I must get going now.
Hang on in there, everything will work out fine!
Promise nothing
Emma, how can you expect me to promise anything under these conditions?
Don't leave me, Louis!
I don't want to get your hopes up, Emma.
I hope you understand...
Farewell
No, Louis!! NO!!
She got what she deserved
Maybe...
But don't count on it.
I... What??
You deserve what's coming to you, Emma, so don't count on me helping you!
No, Louis, you...
Farewell...
Is anyone there?
I can hear you... I know you are there.
Help me, help!
Can anyone hear me?
It's not fair, I don't deserve this...
I didn't do anything...
Help me, please!
Louis! No! Don't leave me!
LOUIS!!
Filthy scum! I'll kill you!
I'll get out of here and I'll come looking for you, Louis de Richet!!
DO YOU HEAR ME?!!
I WILL FIND YOU!!
Is anyone there?
I'm all alone...
Emma? What on earth...?
We only wanted to play... we...
We didn't mean any harm...
She sounds like a little girl talking...
It's me... Louis...
Oh, I know someone called Louis...
But he abandoned me, too.
What on earth is wrong with her?
It seems like her spirit has regressed...
What are you doing here?
I was playing...
At what?
Oh really? And what were we playing at?
We... we were playing hide and seek... but I think I got lost...
I'm all on my own now...
Who with?
And who were we playing with?
With my sister...
But I can't find her.
Emily is here?
Tell me, Emma, is Emily here too?
Emily is always here...
But she makes fun of me... she keeps hiding in the shadows, to make me scared...
And I.. I get scared then... I don't want to follow her in...
I'm all on my own now...
Continue
You're back? You haven't abandoned me...
Oh man, what can I do?...
The poor thing seems completely lost...
Everything is fine, Emma.
Don't worry, everything is going to be alright, you'll see.
Leave her!
This situation is completely beyond me...
All this doesn't exist! I have to find the way out of this dream!
Look, Emma, I'm sure your sister isn't far.
What I suggest is, I go and... and have a look around and... if I find her, I'll... I'll tell her to come and... and see you.
Ok?
Are you going to leave me on my own?
I'm going to see if I can find Emily.
I'll be right back.
No, I don't want to be on my own anymore...
I'll be right back... OK ?
Help her, Louis!
I'm here now, dry your tears.
You aren't going to abandon me?
No, don't worry. You're not alone.
Thank you, sir.
Tell me now, what happened with Emily?
We had a fight...
She was always wanting me to hide, I think.
But I don't want to play at hide and seek anymore.
Do you know why she always wanted to keep on playing?
The one who wins, becomes the princess.
And it's never me who wins... But I want to be a princess too...
Ok, ok.
And you like playing with your sister.
Of course, she's my sister.
And do you love your sister?
Yes, but sometimes she gets on my nerves.
But you wouldn't want her not to play with you anymore, would you?
Of course not...
It would be good if you could both play at being a princess together, at the same time, wouldn't it?
Together?
Yes, each with your own stories.
Oh... Yes, that would be good!
And we would have extraordinary adventures! And we could speak about them together and...
And...
And...
I miss her so much...
Emma? Is that you?
It's all your fault!
If your mother hadn't betrayed me, all this would never have happened!
If you and your mother hadn't come here, all this would never have happened!
You are all the same!
You're the one, Louis, you're the one who assassinated me!
You should be proud of yourself, you've finished what your mother started!
Emma, don't be like...
Leave me alone! I don't need you!
Don't take it like...
Leave me!
Leave me alone!
Is... Is anyone there?
I'm all alone...
Emma? What on earth...?
We only wanted to play... we...
We didn't mean any harm...
You sound like a little girl talking...
It's me... Louis...
Oh, I know someone called Louis...
But he abandoned me, too.

And I.. I get scared then... I don't want to follow her in...
I'm all on my own now...
Continue
You're back? You haven't abandoned me...
Right, what can I do?...
The poor thing seems completely lost...
Alright, Emma.
Don't worry, everything's going to be alright, you'll see.
Leave her!
This situation is completely beyond me...
All this doesn't exist! I have to find the way out of this dream!
Look, Emma, I'm sure you're sister isn't far.
What I suggest, is I go and have a look around and if I find her, I'll tell her to come and see you.
Alright?
Are you going to leave me on my own?
I'm going to see if I can find Emily.
I'll be quick.
No, I don't want to be on my own anymore...
I'll be back...
Help her, Louis!
Dry your tears, I'm here now.
You aren't going to abandon me?
No, don't worry. You are not alone.
Thank you, sir.
Tell me now, what happened with Emily?
We had a fight...

Emma, don't be like...
Leave me alone! I don't need you!
Don't take it like...
Leave me!
Leave me alone!
Help!...
Help me...
Is there anyone there?!
Help me, please...
I'm all alone...
Scum!
Bastards!
I'll get you back! You've all manipulated me!
I'll make you all pay, all of you!!
Good god, I can't even move... But Louis can.
What's happening?
Louis! Hurry, he's coming!
What's happening?!
I can sense him, he's here, he's trying to get inside me, Louis.
William has completely lost his mind!
He's getting ready to pull out all the stops!
He's going to devour my mind, Louis!! I'm not going to be able to stop him!
Louis, you are here, I sense your presence...
What... but he can't even see me...
Congratulations, my son, you have succeeded in joining us!
Louis, don't let him draw you in there!
You are signing your death warrant if you decide to follow him! I won't be there to protect you...
It's over, my son! We have won!
A new order can be born!
Louis, I'm so weak... I can feel him entering...
I.. I can no longer keep him out... he's... he's coming...
Tell him Mortimer is here
He's here...
I... can... can you see him?...
He's here...
He's coming closer to you...
Where? Louis, I don't want to just disappear!...
He's just a few meters away...
He's inside my mind, I can feel him crushing me...
He's just in front of you...
I'm so sorry brother, there's nothing you can do to stop me now.
You made your choice and you have lost.
I was wrong about him from the very begining...
He's mad...
He must be stopped!
Say nothing to him
You can still do something, Louis.
Don't worry, son...
Father?
I am here.
You can go in peace...
Father, I am sorry...
Don't be, you've been infallible right to the end.
I am proud, all those years, watching you grow into who you are today.
But Father, I almost..
No!
If your brother had not been so malicious, you would still be with us.
I am here now. I am going to take care of him.
Count on me to...
Stop! All of you! LEAVE NOW!
Don't let him get away with it, please...
Sorry, I'm going to follow Mortimer
I wanted to believe in you, Uncle...
Louis... no, don't do it...
I can't follow you anymore...
Louis...
He's won...
We put up a good fight, but let's be honest, he won.
I'm sorry, Uncle, but I've decided to follow Father.
But how can you trust him?...
He's my father and there's so much he has to show me.
I'm not responsible for what happened to you. That's your business, the two of you.
You are just as mad as he is, Louis!
You'll end up just like him!
I will follow him to the end
I have been following you, Uncle! And I shall remain with you!
Thank you, Louis!
But w... What must I do?
We must notify the family about what's happening here.
Let me enter you, I shall empower you to do so!
Let Holm enter!
All right, do it quickly!
There, now you can communicate with the Ether...
When you return to reality, go to Elizabeth's room and call the Ether.
You will find an ally there...
Refuse to let him enter
Wh... What??
No, Uncle, you can't ask that of me!
Louis, it's the only way!
I must teach you how...
But that's the rule, never let anyone possess your mind...
Louis...
Sorry, I can't...
I believe neither in him, nor in Mortimer
Look at yourself, Uncle!
You're just as bad as he is !
Despite being centuries old, despite all the wisdom you should have acquired, I don't believe in you, nor do I believe in him.
You can count on me to do my utmost, so that neither of you will succeed in your plans!
You can be so stupid!
As for me, I won't be around much longer!
So if you want to stand the slightest chance against him, at least make sure you are armed, Louis!
What do you mean?
The Lance, Louis!
Have you got the Lance?!
Louis, it's over for me...
It's up to you now, to protect our family!
Find your sister, Louis! She'll know what to do!
What are you saying?
Find her!
Don't let him get away with all this so easily, I implore you...
Sorry, I'm going to follow Mortimer
I neither believe in him nor in Mortimer
It's over, Brother, don't fight it...
You will be punished for this...
Perhaps, but you won't be there to see it, will you ?
You will be puni...
I must be quick...
My memories... I... I'm losing my sense of who... I...
Louis! Are you there?
Yes... Yes, I'm here.
Pick up the thread of my thoughts, Louis, of my memories! Make haste!
Listen to the entire memory
Ah, Charles François... What an adventure..
It was so easy for me to sell your title of Marquis de Maintenon to Françoise d'Aubigné and to sail for the Caribbean islands..
One of my greatest successes!
With one stroke I placed myself right next to the King of France, with a mistress under my orders...
...and I was able to impose my law over the seas of the triangular trade!
Anyhow, I should try to concentrate on his voice.
Follow this memory
I'm getting carried away here.
I must concentrate on the important memories, the ones that led Holm into this situation.
Analyze the memory
He's talking about Charles François d'Angennes. And Françoise d'Aubigné.
They were contemporaries of Louis XIV. This has nothing to do with what brought Holm here.
I ought to look somewhere else.
Ignore
Ah Charles François... What an adventure..
Listen to the entire memory
France... So much effort, so much wasted time!
From Charles Martel to the wars of religion...
I simply did not consider Protestantism to be a real threat and that was my greatest mistake!
My faith in Father and the Catholic Church that he administered made me blind, I can see that now...
I lost France through 100 years of war...
Follow this memory
That's not the right direction.
I must concentrate on the important memories, the ones that led Holm into this situation.
Analyze the memory
The analysis is correct.
But there's no link to what interests me here.
Ignore
France... So much effort, so much wasted time!
Listen to the entire memory
I recall Sparta, of my exchanges back then with my brother...
I did everything in my power to avoid the Peloponnesian War but he wouldn't listen! He always wanted more...
Father wasn't gentle with William back then.
Shutting him in the body of Pericles for 8 years, and reducing Athens and its cursed democracy to its knees...
Follow this memory
I'm losing focus... Come on Louis, concentrate, concentrate!
I must concentrate on the important memories, the ones that led Holm into this situation.
Analyze the memory
One of Holm's distant memories and one of his brother's? With an ego like his, he's undoubtedly talking about Mortimer.
Could there be a link here?
No, at the time they weren't enemies like they are today!
Ignore
I recall Spartacus.
Listen to the entire memory
Dear Countess d'Hunolstein... What a pity you disappointed me!
Managed to swindle La Fayette for the damage he did to the western monarchies...
...So full of remorse once it was done, I don't really regret making you steal the necklace and end up in a convent...
Follow this memory
No, not that way... I'm losing the thread here.
I must concentrate on the important memories, the ones that led Holm into this situation.
Analyze the memory
I heard about this story.
The countess was apparently an acquaintance of Sir Gregory, but this has nothing to do with what's happening at the manor.
I can put that one to the side...
Ignore
Dear Countess d'Hunolstein... What a pity you disappointed me!
I reconstructed the sequence of memories of Sir Gregory Holm
I restored order among the guests
I escaped from the Ether 
I met Asahel's spirit
I could have met Asahel's spirit
I met  Emma Hillsborrow's spirit
I could have met Emma Hillsborrow's spirit
I met Emily Hillsborrow's spirit
I could have met Emily Hillsborrow's spirit
I met Sarah de Richet's spirit
I could have met Sarah de Richet's spirit
I confirmed my support for Lord Mortimer
I confirmed my support for Sir Gregory Holm
I tried to read Asahel's spirit and was rejected
I accepted Asahel's spirit
I accepted Sir Gregory Holm's spirit
I abandoned Sir Gregory Holm to become allied to Lord Mortimer
I chose to serve only the Humans
Dear God, if I lose the war against France, I will be doomed!
I can't hold out...
He broke the rules...
His children... are gathered together? Yes, here...
Be quick!
Louis!
I must speak to you!
He's coming!
Come to me!
I didn't want to believe it...
Wh... But...
What on earth is happening?
I'm dreaming or...
Louis! It's me Gregory! Listen, we don't have much time!
But where are we?
Louis, I brought us here.
You must act swiftly, I can't hold out for long.
William has poisoned me, he must have used the blood of a former Daemon!
I am no longer able to enter the body of someone else.
The poison is gnawing away at me from the inside! I... I'm going to die, Louis...
But where are we?
In the Ether...
What you see is not real, it's only a mental projection created by my spirit.
I'm occupying William's spirit at the moment but I'm not going to be able to keep it up forever.
Join me, Louis, otherwise all will be lost!
Yes! Yes, I'll join you.
Find a way... Hurry...
I must find them quickly...
Wh... But...
What on earth is happening?
I'm dreaming or...
Louis! It's me Gregory! Listen, we don't have much time!
But where are you?
Louis, I brought us here.
You must find us quickly, I can't hold out for long.
William has poisoned me, he must have used the blood of a former Daemon!
I am no longer able to enter the body of someone else.
The poison is gnawing away at me from the inside! I... I'm going to die, Louis...
But where are we?
In the Ether...
What you see is not real, it's only mental projections created by my spirit.
I'm occupying William's spirit at the moment but I'm not going to be able to keep it up forever.
Join me, Louis, otherwise all will be lost!
I'm coming!
Find the way... Hurry...
I must find them quickly...
What?... But... I'm still in the conference room...
What on earth is going on here?...
If nothing is real, I'll have to be careful!
What?... But... I'm still in the conference room...
What on earth is going on here?...
If nothing is real, I'll have to be careful!
Listen to the entire memory
It was a trap right from the start.
At the previous conference, three years ago, I'm sure he already knew I would bring the Hillsborrow sisters here.
He knew it! He knew it! He already knew they were his daughters!
Follow this memory
This is the first event that brought Holm here.
Oh yeah, I'm on the right track...
Analyze the memory
The previous conference. That's when Mortimer started putting his plan into action!
That's how this whole thing began.
Ignore
It was a trap right from the start.
Listen to the entire memory
He allowed me to bring Emily back again to this conference.
Supposedly to find her sister, whereas Emma hadn't even disappeared yet!
The poor wretch was shot as her sister was setting foot on the island.
I should have understood that earlier!
Follow this memory
No, not yet...
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
I'm on the right track here...
Analyze the memory
It's about my first vision on the island! The day of my arrival.
This could be the beginning of the story, yet Holm is talking about bringing Emily back again.
So there must have been something before this.
Ignore
He allowed me to bring Emily to this conference.
Listen to the entire memory
And coincidentally, who arrives at the same time as Emily?
Louis de Richet! His son!
He brings his four children together and even then, I didn't react...
Follow this memory
There's something missing.
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
I'm getting closer to him.
Analyze the memory
This is about my arrival. As well as Emily's.
There must be an earlier memory that talks about my sisters!
Ignore
And coincidentally, who arrives at the same time as Emily?
Listen to the entire memory
And when Elizabeth disappeared, I...
No... it's not possible! I couldn't have missed that, not me!
He cut me off from our Father and I didn't say a word!
Follow this memory
I must have missed a memory...
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
One more.
Analyze the memory
Elizabeth's presence was crucial for Holm. If she was still here, he'd still be alive.
This memory is important, without a shadow of a doubt.
It took place after my arrival with Emily and Cardinal Piaggi but well before I found out the truth about my nature.
Ignore
And when Elizabeth disappeared, I...
Listen to the entire memory
He feeds Louis and I continue to see nothing...
He stuffed his poor son with an occult knowledge that we usually take months to give to our children!
And Louis is only trying his best to get by... he doesn't realize he's being led to the slaughter!
Follow this memory
What have I missed?
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
Getting to the end here.
Analyze the memory
So Holm seems certain that Mortimer has been using me...
But I get the impression that he's only had this vision recently...
It's one of the last ones he had.
Ignore
He feeds Louis and I continue to see nothing...
Listen to the entire memory
And the cherry on the cake, is I drank his cursed tea!
He knew I would drink it! The rascal knows me better than I do myself!!
Follow this memory
I should come back to this later.
This memory is important but it's as if there's something missing.
There must be an order to this.
Analyze the memory
The blood that Mortimer used is deadly poison for a Daemon. Holm won't survive it.
It's over for him. He's finished...
Ignore
He trapped me!!
He poisoned me to stop me from being able to leave this body!
He cut off all communication with Father and brought his children here!!
How could I not have seen it earlier!
He is going to absorb me! The traitor!
No one can stop him now!
Hurry, Louis! I absolutely must see you before it's too late!
If you have managed to follow my thoughts, come to me!! Quickly!!...
And the cherry on the cake, is I drank his cursed tea!
I deserve a great destiny, and I will let nothing, nor no one stand in the way of my dream!
I won't let him attack his brother!
I have to protect my sister. Help me, Louis!
Goddammit, I don't understand a thing! I'm doomed...
Looks like I've succeeded, they've all disappeared...
Louis! It's worked! But... Don't waste any time!
Yes, I'm coming!
At least... as soon as I've found the exit!
I can count on my father and my son to defend me... Yes, but will they make it in time?
What am I doing here now?
Nothing seems real...
You're nothing but a coward!
What a bunch of amateurs you are!
Please, keep calm!
What on earth is going on here?!
I don't understand a thing!
Louis, don't waste any time!
Appease them, my thoughts are becoming confused...
Help me!
Be quick!
Yes...
Not a minute to lose!
Analyse this situation
One thing is for sure, my mother and Wöllner have the same objective: to find that book.
They're following the same trail and must be close to each other.
Leave
I need to keep an eye on them...
He wants to isolate me again!
Analyse this situation
That's not really Elizabeth, it's another Daemon... Who wants to protect Holm from Mortimer...
On a symbolic level, he should be placed between the two of them.
Leave
Analyse this situation
Emma is completely lost. She needs to be close to her sister.
As for Emily, she no longer trusts anyone. Apart from me that is... I have to stay by her side.
Leave
Stay with me, Louis! We must take Al Azif back from him!
Whatever happens, I trust him and only him! I must take the book back to him...
I'm so lucky to serve Lord Mortimer...
"Beneath your compassion, we take refuge, O Mother of God:"
Sarah? Is that you ?
Louis???
Louis, can you hear me? I'm here, Louis!
Can you see me?
Of course!
But, I don't understand...
Ah merciful heaven! You CAN see me!!!
Yes, I...
Louis, I don't know what's happening but you must help me!
Look just... just calm down...
I can't see you, Louis!
I'm here right in front of you...
No, I can't see you. The quays are deserted!
I can't leave, Louis! Help me!
You died...
Died? No! What are you talking about?!
Look, I am right here!
We are in the Ether
We're not on the quays.
Yes, we are, I haven't moved!
I promise you, I wish you were right!  But you're not.
It would seem that we're in what they call the Ether.
Their world of spirits!...
I was sure it existed!...
The poor woman is completely losing touch with reality...
What you see is not real.
I'm not sure I understand myself
It's just as confusing for me.
I... I'm no better off than you, I... I don't really understand everything that's going on...
All I can say is, what we see isn't real.
Her spirit is here because she's a Daemon
And as you are my sister...
It's possible that Daemons don't completely disappear after their physical bodies die.
But... But how is that possible ? Dammit!
I'm stuck here!
I don't know, I... I'm only guessing...
Only your physical body is dead. Apparently your spirit is kept here.
I daren't try understand... I...
Am I condemned?
Look, neither of us know anything about this situation really...
Help me, Louis!
You are the first one, the only one, to see me... To speak to me...
Without you, I'll never get out of here!
Don't leave me like this! I beg you!
I am a prisoner too
Me neither... For the moment I'm stuck here, too...
After all you're the occult expert, you must have some idea... you tell me...
Not a single one.
I won't stand for this... No, this is simply impossible...
I... I must focus on a solution...
Too bad for her!
Next time you want to abduct a child and lie to him his whole life, maybe you'll think twice.
Louis, no! Don't leave me here!
Good luck...
Calm her down
Listen... You have to stay positive.
Seeing as I've entered the Ether I... I must be able to leave it... If it's possible for me, then it's possible for you...
Do you really think so?
Rational and open... Remember ?
I... yes, right... you are right!
There must be a solution...!
But how come you can move around?
I'm not dead.
I don't understand!
I think there are many things that you don't understand.
It doesn't matter! I trust you!
You are going to help me, aren't you?
I must be getting on. I... I can't stay much longer.
Louis, I beseech you! Promise you're going to help me!
Promise her
Of course I'm going to help you, Mother...
Thank you, Louis...
I trust you! Thank you...
Leave her!
Farewell.
No! LOUIS, NO!!
DON'T LEAVE ME!!!
Pretend you are going to help her
Of course I'm going to help you, Mother...
Thank you, Louis...
I trust you! Thank you...
Sarah?
Louis???
Louis, can you hear me? I'm here, Louis!
Can you see me?
Of course!
I don't understand...
Aaah merciful heaven! YOU CAN SEE ME!!!
Yes, I...
Louis, I don't know what's happening but you must help me!
Calm dow...
I can't see you, Louis!
I'm here in front of you...
No, I can't see you. The quays are deserted!
I can't leave, Louis! Help me!
You died three days ago...
Died? No, what are you talking about?!
Look, I am right here!
We are in the Ether
We are not on the quays.
Yes, we are, I haven't moved!
I promise you, I wish you were right!  But you are not.
But it would seem that we are in what they call, the Ether.
Their world of spirits!...
I was sure it existed!...
The poor thing is completely losing touch with reality...
What you see is not real.
I'm not sure I understand myself
It's just as confusing for me.
I'm no better off than you... I don't really understand everything that's going on...
All I can say is, what we see isn't real.
Her spirit is here because she's a Daemon
And as you are... my sister...

But... But why dammit?
I'm stuck here!
I don't know, I'm only guessing...
Only your physical body is dead. Apparently your spirit is kept here.
I daren't try understand... I...
Am I condemned?
Look, neither of us know anything about this situation...

Too bad for her!

Louis, no! Don't leave me here!
Good luck...

Thank you, Louis...
I trust you! Thank you...
But there must be a way...
Rational...
Rational and open, Sarah!
Think, dammit! THINK!
History will remember me, and the sacrifices I made!
I sense that something is happening...
But I can no longer move!
