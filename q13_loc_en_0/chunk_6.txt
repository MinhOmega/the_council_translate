I could have found the cards that von Wöllner stole from Lord Mortimer
I found Lady Hillsborrow in her room
I could have found Lady Hillsborrow in her room
Well my friends, here we all are!
Isn't the duchess meant to be with us?
No, she's resting in her room. Don't worry.
The conference can resume.
Now we all know the tensions have been runing high.
But now is not the moment to give in.
The main thing is that just one vote can suffice to...
Yes indeed, it will only take one of you opposing his project to win the conference...
But I would rather have us united until the end.
Meanwhile, let us remain on our guard against any last-minute surprises. I know my brother well and he never prepares for war if he has no chance of winning.
Rational and open.
I've spent my whole life swimming in lies.
Emily... what a waste.
Emma... what a bloody mess! I've been completely manipulated!
I feel like I know nothing, that I have to learn everything all over again.
I'm a Daemon.
I age more slowly, I can mentally manipulate people.
I don't even know if it's a good thing or a curse.
It's good!
No, no this is an advantage!
I could get used to this pretty quickly, I think!
It's a curse
Frankly, I... I feel like I'm cursed.
I hope I'll be able to control this new skill, otherwise my life will be hell.
Damn it, what a mess!
Come on, man up, Louis!
I'm still the same old me. Daemon or not, I'm still in charge of my actions!
And this father I know nothing about.
Yes... I've still got a lot to learn!
It's enough to drive you crazy! Everything I believed in... Nothing holds true anymore.
Pull yourself together, man!
I need to find some answers.
There's no way of being alone for a minute.

My dear Giuseppe,
As my health does not allow me to honor Sir Holm's invitation to go to Lord Mortimer's, 
I should be grateful if you would sit at a conference on my behalf.
Naturally, you will give my thanks to your hosts.
Consolidate our agreements with Sir Gregory and let him know that his venture regarding Cardinal-Bishop Chiaramonti is following its course.
I have every confidence in you.
May God bless and protect you
S. S. Giovanni Angelo Braschi
P.S.: Do not use your personal stamp when writing to me. Instead use the one with my motto on it.

My dear Giuseppe,
I know you are on your way to Lord Mortimer's residence,
I hope you have a good trip, even though you are obliged to cross the French countryside at present very agitated.
Know that this mission is crucial, my friend.
May God bless and protect you.

Right... it's time I got started.
Let's see what I can find here to help me write that letter.
I have no means to validate my forgery, so I'd better take my time with it and not make any mistakes.
There are two letters from the pope on the desk. I should be able to get a clue or two by checking how well they correspond to each other.
And here are three stamps, all are different...
Read the letters on the desk
Read the first letter
Read the second letter
Put down the letters
Choose the contents of the letter
Right... Let's start writing...
Lord Mortimer asked me to discredit Sir Gregory and to announce Piaggi's final vote in his favor.
As an introduction... “Your Holiness, thank you for your trust...
Discredit Holm
“It turns out, now that I'm here, that I find Lord Mortimer's projects grant us many more advantages, in comparison to what Sir Gregory had suggested.”
“We are talking about the future of the Holy See”... There, that should be enough to justify the change of vote!
Discredit Mortimer
“As we informed Sir Gregory, it is of absolute necessity that Lord Mortimer's projects do not come to fruition.”
“We are talking about the future of the Holy See.”
Discredit both
“It even appears that Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory both have access to obscure, superior forces to help them reach their ends.”
