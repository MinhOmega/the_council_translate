We couldn't have known... We made a mistake, damn it!
That feeling...
It hurts all of a sudden!
Success
I... she... she's there, I... I can feel her inside me...
She's trying to read my thoughts!
Emily... Don't do that! Get out of my mind, please.
Let me remind you that it's forbidden between Daemons.
I... sorry, Louis.
I didn't want to...
(default)
You?... You too?...
I love you, Louis. I can't bear it... It hurts so terribly!
I...
I don't know what to say, I...
I think it's gonna take time.
I agree with you...
It was a mistake...
Are you reading my thoughts?
Emily!
I... I'm sorry... excuse me...
I have a sister.
It's... It's very strange for me too...
A sister for a brother...
Yes...
Yes...
I must get some rest... I must ask you to leave me now...
Alright but don't finish that bottle...
Don't start, now!
I would like to get some sleep...
I'll be leaving you then.
I... Thank you, Emily.
Emily?
Can I come in?
I... no... it's not a good time.
Not right now, leave me alone.
Insist.
I can tell from your voice that... that there's something wrong...
Let me in.
We have to talk, Emily!
I said no, goddamn you!
Enter anyway
Leave.
Leave.
Oh! Your... Your arm! It's awful!
Now she notices?
I... an accident, it's nothing serious...
We have to talk...
I was just wondering...
Uh-oh... what's she smiling for?
Right, I shall begin.
It's going to be an awful lot for you to take in on just one day....
But.... I must tell you that I'm a Daemon too.
Excuse me?
I know that you are too... Gregory told me everything during my convalescence.
Your convalescence?
Long story short...
For starters I'm not Emily.
What?
You can't be disappointed...
You're the one who chose... must I remind you?
If only I'd known.
I made a huge mistake!
She should be where you are now!
Well, it's too late now.
You rotten bitch!
Don't make her mad.
I had a fifty-fifty chance...
A fifty-fifty chance of getting the right one: me!
That remains to be proven.
Careful Louis... Don't be hurtful...
You're better off for it, believe me...
There, now there are no secrets between us.
Fine... whatever you say.
And that isn't all... I'm also Mortimer's daughter.
You understand... what that means I hope...
I...
Er...
That's right. I am a Daemon too, and I am your sister.
And we also slept together!
But don't be too hard on yourself...
It's a bit unnatural when you think about it, but then you couldn't know...
This way at least, everything stays in the family, it's for the best...
It mustn't prevent us from living out our affair in the open, however.
Our affair?
Have you lost your mind?
I'm far too soft on you... I'll let you have everything, of course!
So don't be nasty, if you don't mind.
Calm her down.
She's not all there, it's... it's plain to see.
Yes... true, it's... it's been a long day.
Yes... You ought to get some rest.
You can sleep there, you know that, right?
Although... thinking about it.
Don't be taken in
Emma... It doesn't make sense...
The mere thought makes me sick!
Shut up!
You always have to ruin everything!
But not this time, do you hear me?
