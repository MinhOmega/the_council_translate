I... he wanted to bid me welcome.
I don't understand...
Welcome... to the family.
I... You...
You're his daughter?
Mortimer's daughter, Louis.
What... No... No, that's no... that's not possible!
If...
So we have...
We are brother and sister?
This is too much, Louis... much too much for me, Louis!
I can't look myself in the mirror.
I should never have spent the night with you...
So that means Emma was my sister as well!
Yes, Louis... we have all sinned!
That makes you... my sister?
Yes...
Just the thought of the night when I suggested that we... I feel so ashamed, Louis.
And that means Emma was your sister too.
Thankfully, she will never know...
No... No... it's... it's...
How could I have ever known?
Emily...
No...
I didn't know!
Oh shit... I spent the night with my own sister...
I was attracted to you from the moment we first spoke, on the boat.
Now I understand why...
Do you realize what that means?
I'm a monster!
I am attracted too...
And I am one, as well...
When I think of my feelings for you, I...
We've committed an error.
We couldn't have known... We made a mistake, damn it!
That feeling...
It hurts all of a sudden!
Success
I... she... she's there, I... I can feel her inside me...
She's trying to read my thoughts!
Emily... Don't do that! Get out of my mind, please.
Let me remind you that it's forbidden between Daemons.
I... sorry, Louis.
I didn't want to...
(default)
You?... You too?...
I love you, Louis. I can't bear it... It hurts so terribly!
I...
I don't know what to say, I...
I think it's gonna take time.
I agree with you...
It was a mistake...
Are you reading my thoughts?
Emily!
I... I'm sorry... excuse me...
I have a sister.
It's... It's very strange for me too...
A sister for a brother...
Yes...
Yes...
I must get some rest... I must ask you to leave me now...
Alright but don't finish that bottle...
Don't start, now!
I would like to get some sleep...
I'll be leaving you then.
I... Thank you, Emily.
Oh! Your arm! How awful!
Now she notices it?
I... I had an accident, forget about it...
If you say so...
You've been drinking...
Why aren't I surprised?....
Do you think you'll find the solution in alcohol?
Get out of here, Louis!
I told you not to come in!
I just wanted to explain that...
I don't want to hear why you let me kill your mother...
Well, it turns out she isn't my mother...
It makes no difference to me!
How far will her anger go
First your sister. Now my mother...
How far will your anger go?
Do... Do you really think I'm not suffering?
She will pay one day
Everyone pays one day or another, Emily...
And you already have a hefty debt......
If you think you can frighten me...
Go! Leave me!
(In tears)
You know nothing! You understand nothing!
On the contrary!
If you'd given me more time, if you had listened to me...
It was impossible for me to know.
Of course it wasn't...
I know I can't really ask... But please, forgive me...for what I have done...
Everything that goes on in here is... is much bigger than you and me.
You made your choices and... and now you're going to have to take responsibility for them.
You know full well that getting yourself worked up like this, is not going to help!
It won't make any difference...
It won't bring Emma back.
