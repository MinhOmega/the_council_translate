Very well, Piaggi, you win!
I refuse to let you do the first thing that comes into your head.
I don't know what the two of you are up to, but I'll find out sooner or later.
Right, time for me to get back into my body.
Right, don't just stand there, Louis. Mortimer's waiting for you in the red salon!
Bad Outcome
Listen carefully, Piaggi! If you say anything, you'll be the one they find dead in your bed!
Now, just turn around and let me handle this!
Success
Don't touch him!
You could have killed me!
Out of my room!
You'll pay for this, Piaggi! This is not over!
Come on, Louis! Concentrate!
I did it!
Don't just stand there! Get out and go see Mortimer!
default
Stop!
Now, if you don't want to end up the same way, you will do as you are told and vote what we tell you!
Is that understood?
I forbid you...
WÃ¶llner!!...
No! He's infected my body with whatever's in that syringe!...
He's poisoned me!!...
Get out, Louis! No one must find you here!
