Oh! Your arm! How awful!
Now she notices it?
I... I had an accident, forget about it...
If you say so...
You've been drinking...
Why aren't I surprised?....
Do you think you'll find the solution in alcohol?
Get out of here, Louis!
I told you not to come in!
I just wanted to explain that...
I don't want to hear why you let me kill your mother...
Well, it turns out she isn't my mother...
It makes no difference to me!
How far will her anger go
First your sister. Now my mother...
How far will your anger go?
Do... Do you really think I'm not suffering?
She will pay one day
Everyone pays one day or another, Emily...
And you already have a hefty debt......
If you think you can frighten me...
Go! Leave me!
(In tears)
You know nothing! You understand nothing!
On the contrary!
If you'd given me more time, if you had listened to me...
It was impossible for me to know.
Of course it wasn't...
I know I can't really ask... But please, forgive me...for what I have done...
Everything that goes on in here is... is much bigger than you and me.
You made your choices and... and now you're going to have to take responsibility for them.
You know full well that getting yourself worked up like this, is not going to help!
It won't make any difference...
It won't bring Emma back.
Forget... I couldn't give a damn if it makes any difference! I only want to not think of anything...
And then get out of here!
I told you not to come in!
Emily... I only want to talk...
I understand that you're upset after everything that...
You understand... You understand nothing!
Listen... We're going through a difficult time. Even I'm dumbfounded and I...
Dumbfounded?... "Dumbfounded"!
Do you want to know how I feel?
[MIND READING]
Dear God, how could I have done this... I want it to stop!
Go with her
Yes, I would like toâ€¦
My whole life has just gone up in smoke!
Everything I believed in gone, blown apart!
I have killed a part of myself!!
Yes, I... I know how you feel.
No.... I don't think so!
I've found out that my mother has been lying to me all my life.
That she's not my real mother.
And I let you finish her off instead of me...
And I killed her.
I told her to go far... far away
Why, Louis?
What have we done to deserve this?
I don't think that's the question.
We haven't done anything, only made choices for which we must accept responsibility.
And what if I no longer have the strength to do so?
But you do.
It's just too early for you to feel it.
But believe me...
Make her talk.
Go on, I'm listening...
Go on, I'm listening!
Do you think you're in the middle of an interrogation?
Nobody gives a bloody damn about how I am...
She is overwhelmed with guilt
I know you regret what happened to your sister, I...
It's gone too far.
I would never have come if I had known... I didn't want to hurt her...
We have...
I have lost everything...
I am all alone now.
She is drunk
You've had too much to drink, Emilly...
Oh, shut up!
If you're just going to talk nonsense, you may as well keep quiet!
Look, I want to help you...
Oh, I'm so touched!
We've all lost something here...
All this... Everything that's happened... it's a nightmare!!!
I want to wake up...
Emily... Calm down... Put down that glass and...
I must tell you something important..
Emily, listen to me...
I'm fed up with talking...
It's about what's happening here...
It's about Mortimer and Holm... They're...
I know you're telling the truth about Mortimer and Holm...
I know they are Daemons...
That's not all...
Go on...
I'm one of them, Emily. I'm a Daemon, too.
I know.
But... but how?
Sir Gregory stopped by to tell me.
