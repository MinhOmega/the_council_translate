Forget... I couldn't give a damn if it makes any difference! I only want to not think of anything...
And then get out of here!
I told you not to come in!
Emily... I only want to talk...
I understand that you're upset after everything that...
You understand... You understand nothing!
Listen... We're going through a difficult time. Even I'm dumbfounded and I...
Dumbfounded?... "Dumbfounded"!
Do you want to know how I feel?
[MIND READING]
Dear God, how could I have done this... I want it to stop!
Go with her
Yes, I would like toâ€¦
My whole life has just gone up in smoke!
Everything I believed in gone, blown apart!
I have killed a part of myself!!
Yes, I... I know how you feel.
No.... I don't think so!
I've found out that my mother has been lying to me all my life.
That she's not my real mother.
And I let you finish her off instead of me...
And I killed her.
I told her to go far... far away
Why, Louis?
What have we done to deserve this?
I don't think that's the question.
We haven't done anything, only made choices for which we must accept responsibility.
And what if I no longer have the strength to do so?
But you do.
It's just too early for you to feel it.
But believe me...
Make her talk.
Go on, I'm listening...
Go on, I'm listening!
Do you think you're in the middle of an interrogation?
Nobody gives a bloody damn about how I am...
She is overwhelmed with guilt
I know you regret what happened to your sister, I...
It's gone too far.
I would never have come if I had known... I didn't want to hurt her...
We have...
I have lost everything...
I am all alone now.
She is drunk
You've had too much to drink, Emilly...
Oh, shut up!
If you're just going to talk nonsense, you may as well keep quiet!
Look, I want to help you...
Oh, I'm so touched!
We've all lost something here...
All this... Everything that's happened... it's a nightmare!!!
I want to wake up...
Emily... Calm down... Put down that glass and...
I must tell you something important..
Emily, listen to me...
I'm fed up with talking...
It's about what's happening here...
It's about Mortimer and Holm... They're...
I know you're telling the truth about Mortimer and Holm...
I know they are Daemons...
That's not all...
Go on...
I'm one of them, Emily. I'm a Daemon, too.
I know.
But... but how?
Sir Gregory stopped by to tell me.
I... he wanted to bid me welcome.
I don't understand...
Welcome... to the family.
I... You...
You're his daughter?
Mortimer's daughter, Louis.
What... No... No, that's no... that's not possible!
If...
So we have...
We are brother and sister?
This is too much, Louis... much too much for me, Louis!
I can't look myself in the mirror.
I should never have spent the night with...
So that means Emma is my sister as well!
Yes, Louis... we have all sinned!
That makes you... my sister?
Yes...
Just the thought of the night when I suggested that we... I feel so ashamed, Louis.
And that means Emma is your sister too.
Thankfully, she will never know...
No... No... it's... it's...
How could I have ever known?
Emily...
No...
I didn't know!
Oh shit... I spent the night with my own sister...
I was attracted to you from the moment we first spoke, on the boat.
Now I understand why...
Do you realize what that means?
I'm a monster!
I am attracted too...
And I am one, as well...
When I think of my feelings for you, I...
We've committed an error.
