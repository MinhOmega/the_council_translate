Ah! Aahhh... I've done it!!
I've done it, damn it!!! He was right!!
This is just crazy... I can't believe it...
Look at yourself, Louis. You better not get caught!
Woah... I still need to get used to this body.
So... let's see about what Mortimer asked me.
Ah, well... Louis...
What brings you back to my chambers?
May I sit down?
Of course, Louis. Don't you feel very well?
Yes, but if I'm gonna pass inside you, I'd better sit myself down first.
It's nothing, don't worry about it.
Well, what can I do for you?
Right, now I need to concentrate.
I wanted to speak to you, your Eminence.
Speak to him about Daemons
Do you believe in Daemons?
What are you going on about, Louis?
Where is he going with this?
I can feel something...
Daemons, your Eminence!
I am a Cardinal, of course I believe in evil!
What on earth is the matter with him? Is he losing his mind or what?
Alright hang in there, Louis, don't lose him!
Rest assured, your Eminence, I'm fine...
I... But... it's impossi...
Rest assured, your Eminence, I am fine...
Speak to him about politics
What exactly is your role with regard to the Holy-Father?
I...What?
What on earth is he playing at?
It's coming!
You're a Cardinal in pectore... Why don't you admit it?
Impertinent little brat!
Louis, I don't find this conversation in very good taste!
Alright, it's coming!
Come on, Giuseppe, let me in...
WH...
Speak to him about the Holy Lance
I wanted to thank you for your help...
I mean, for your time talking to me about the Holy Lance.
Oh, and did you find it?
It's the crusade of a lifetime for some people, Louis... You are searching for another Holy Grail.
Nearly there... Link into his thoughts!
Does it annoy you at all?
But... What on earth is he trying to get at?
Why do you ask, Louis?
I don't follow...
For the glory, your Eminence...
I can feel it coming! It's working!
What insolence!
Why... Really! I am a man of the Church, Louis!
May God keep me from such ambitions.
Right... let me in, your Eminence...
Why, rea...
Speak to him about the conference
Your Eminence, I'd like to speak to you about the conference.
Sorry, my son, but I would rather not speak about it...
Damn it. Change subjects, Louis...
Quick!
Ah! Aahhh... I've done it!!
I've done it, damn it!!! He was right!!
This is just crazy... I can't believe it...
Look at yourself, Louis. You better not get caught!
Woah... I still need to get used to this body.
So... let's see about what Mortimer asked me.
Sir, I am sorry but I cannot let you enter.
I am sorry, sir, but access to this room is not authorized by my master.
Louis... Busy as always, I see?
How lucky you are... I must admit I'm trying to kill the boredom myself...
That's the least you can say...
I get the impression we're all in the same boat...
And here I was thinking you might have some juicy gossip...
And yourself, anything to tell?
Me? No, nothing at all... And you?
I would like to be able to say yes, but it's been dead quiet...
The only one with anything to say is Duke Manuel, but with that accent of his, I don't understand a word he says. It's exasperating...
Right, I've wasted enough time!
I'll keep our conversation to myself, Mr President. Anyway, I must be going now.
See you later, Louis.
No, alas...
I wish I could entertain you, but apart from recommending a few paintings, I don't know what to suggest...
That's very kind of you but I'm quite sick of gazing at all those modern paintings!
Thank you all the same...
A last guest is expected
Well, mister Godoy heard that we are expecting a last minute guest...
Pardon?
Yes, a certain Al Azif.
Hmm... Strange... Doesn't ring a bell...
Might as well not hang out here any longer if he has nothing to say...
Me neither...
He must have misunderstood, the conference has started...
Godoy is a little too used to court intrigue if you ask me...
I agree with you...
Well, nevertheless, I hope I have distracted you a little.
Yes, thank you, Louis, I don't need much!
And don't hesitate if you ever do have any news.
I won't, Mr President.
I haven't the time
I'm sorry, Mr President, but I don't have a minute to spare right now and...
