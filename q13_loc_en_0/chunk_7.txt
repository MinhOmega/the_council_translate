“I think that the Papal States, for the sake of their own preservation, ought to condemn this practice of conferences in the future.”
Choose a stamp for the letter
I noticed something about the stamp
In one of the letters, the pope asked Piaggi to change, and to stop using his personal stamp...
He asked him to use the one with the pope's motto on it...
I know that
And I remember that...
Floret in Domo Domini
The pope's motto...
Must be in Latin...
Go back
Look at the stamp on the right
I have already read a letter from Piaggi...
I've already seen this seal...
Yes, it looks like the stamp that Piaggi applied to the letter he handed to me!
Compare with Piaggi's letter
Piaggi once gave me a sealed letter...
It had the same seal on it, I remember now!
Look at the inscription on the stamp
"Giustizia, Misericordia e Umiltà." Boy, I gotta brush up my foreign languages.
Translate
I think it's in Italian: “Justice, Mercy and Humility”.

I've already read a letter from Piaggi!
I remember the seal that Piaggi used for the letter he confided me with...
I don't recognize this one...
Compare with Piaggi's letter
This seal is different to the one Piaggi used for the letter he gave me...
Yes, I'm certain of it...
Look at the inscription on the stamp
On it is written...
"Floret in Domo Domini"

Latin.
“It blooms in the house of God”

Look at the stamp on the left
I've already read a letter from Piaggi!
When Piaggi handed me that letter to give to my mother, I noticed the seal...
And this one is clearly different...
Compare with Piaggi's letter
Now... I distinctly remember the seal that Piaggi used on the letter he gave me...
This isn't the same stamp.
Look at the inscription on the stamp...
A circle with a cross inside.

Write a secret code
There's a kind of code composed of six letters that they always write under the dates of their correspondence.
According to Mortimer, it's got something to do with Piaggi's tattoo...
I guess I'll have to write one for today's date.
Now, ideally it'd be better to do without it... but I'm gonna need to be extremely clever here!

Think about the logic of the code
In the letters from the pope, there are 6 letters just below the date.
2 just below the month, 4 others below the year.
Piaggi's tattoo... It must be used to establish a connection between the letter of the concentric circle and the numbers shown in the middle.
Think!
Some figures are the same in both codes... yet they correspond to different letters.
The day is not translated. That must be the key to the code!

Do without the code
I could pretend that the code got erased during the voyage, as if the letter arrived in really bad condition...
That would be perfectly understandable given that it's traveled across the seas, right?
