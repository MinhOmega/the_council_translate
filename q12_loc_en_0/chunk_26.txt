Why?
Because I'm his daughter!
I know what he's doing.
I see he has his eye on you. He's hovering around you, tempting you. He did it to me before you.
And if you don't live up to his expectations, he will cast you away.
Is that what happened to you?
I wasn't good enough for him so he rejected me.
What do you mean?
He tried to initiate me but it would seem I am unable to develop his talent. I can't withdraw my mind from my body.
I get it. The reason why you abducted me is because he didn't love you, isn't it?
He doesn't love anyone, Louis. Don't be taken in.
I forgive her
You are my mother.
Whatever you've done, I can't take that away from you.
It doesn't excuse everything, but in time we will find a way of putting it all behind us.
OhÂ ! Thank you, Louis.
Thank you! I will never lie to you again!
Come on, let's go.
No, Mother.
I'm not going back with you, I can't.
What do you mean? Louis, you can't stay here! He will...
Don't worry about me.
I have to stay. I still have a lot to learn.
But you go.
Louis...
I'll see you in Paris, don't worry.
Give her Piaggi's letter and her bag.
Here, this is yours...
Give her Piaggi's letter
Here, this is yours.
Give her back her bag
Here, take this. This is yours.
Keep everything
Don't forget, Louis. You've got the Lance. You can beat him!
If you hit him with it, he won't be able to escape from his mortal envelope and he will die with it.
I never want to see her again
You are going to take that boat and return to France.
I never want to see you again.
Louis, no! Don't say that!
Not after everything I've done for you!! You have no right...
MIND READER
You are mine!
You will never be free! I will find you and you will fall back into line! Like all your brothers and sisters.
Until you're ready to take him on!
Kill her!
Let her leave
Say farewell to her.
Farewell, Mother. Take care of yourself.
Drop dead
You are not my mother!!
You're crazy, woman!! I'll never be yours!!
You're not my mother!!
In spite of everything, she was right.
I'm a little mixed up... but I do understand your choice.
You were wrong not to speak to me about it before.
But I understand that you didn't want to leave me with him.
Oh thank you, Louis!
I promise never to lie to you again, my son.
Come, let's go home...
I can't.
What do you mean? Why not?
I've got to know.
Trust me.
We'll meet in Paris.
He wants you, Louis! He will never let you go!
Don't worry.
Excuse me, Monsieur, Lord Mortimer is asking for you.
Excuse me, Monsieur, we cannot let you pass.
Emily...
What are you doing here?
You wouldn't have seen...
Mother!
No!
No! What's happened?
No, Mother! No!!
She's ruined my life, Louis.
I am sorry...
What were you thinking?
Emma meant everything to me.
Your mother destroyed everything by shooting her.
She was me and I was her!
MIND READER
Dear God, I beg you, make him kill me...
I've had enough of it all... I no longer have the strength in me...
I HAD TO SPEAK TO HER!!
I NEEDED TO TALK TO HER!!
She was going to tell me everything!!
I am sorry...
I did what Emma would have done.
But Sarah's not the one who killed Emma!
You're the one who killed Emma! Not my mother!!
And it wouldn't have happened if Sarah hadn't struck out at Emma first!
Kill her!
She was going to tell me everything!!
Get her out of my sight
Get out of here...
Why have you always lied to me?...
...
Why didn't you ever tell me I was his son?...
Emily...
