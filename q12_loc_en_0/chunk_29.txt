Oh... You still don't get it...
The night of the conference...
It wasn't poor Emily who paid you a little visit in your room. Oh, she was much too busy with Monsieur Bonaparte.
No, that's not true...
It was me, of course.
I assure you, you got something a whole lot better.
And when I think she wasn't even armed when I arrived.
Right! Take a moment to think and meet me at the Manor, later.
You're crazy!
Now, now, Louis! Don't push it!
I understand your grief, but I won't put up with that sort of talk from you, or anybody.
MIND READER
If he says one more word, I won't be around to satisfy any of his desires!
Die!
Wait, madame...
She's crazy...
But I... you've lost your mind...
That's enough!
That's not how you talk to a lady!
Let her go!
I'd like to be alone, Madame.
That's alright. I'd rather that, too.
See you later, Louis.
Strangle the crazy woman!
She's stark raving mad...
Die, you bitch!
