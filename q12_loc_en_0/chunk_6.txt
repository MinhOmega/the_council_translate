No, it isn't fair!
I haven't done all this for nothing!! Holm promised me I could be the only Duchess Hillsborrow from now on!
Lower your arm, Emma!
Lower your weapon, Emma...
No... I've gone too far to stop here!
You are trying to manipulate me again, I can tell!
No, why do you say that?
That poor Emma is stupid! She would swallow any story you wanted, wouldn't she?
No one will ever manipulate me again!
That's enough, she's finished!
It's all over for you.
You're going to have some explaining to do after all of this.
What? Are you threatening me?
Do you really think you are in a position to do so?
And what if I take your mother out first? At the stage I'm at...
Play on her fantasy of being the Duchess
Unless you decide to kill everyone on this island, you'll have to explain your actions once you get back.
All this effort to become the only Duchess Hillsborrow, ruined in an instant..
She betrayed me!!
You will be tracked down.
Hunted! Like a criminal.
...
In the end, there will have only been one Duchess Hillsborrow. Emil...
I AM Duchess Hillsborrow!
Mortimer is a Daemon!
Mortimer is a Daemon...
In the literal sense of the word.
He and Sir Gregory have been living amongst us for several centuries now.
I know, Louis.
What?? You knew?
Of course! And they can even read our thoughts, would you believe that!
But it makes no difference!
I serve Gregory!
Mortimer can drop dead! He absolutely deserves it.
Get it off your chest, Louis
Emma...
Stop it...
Come with me.
...
She deserves to die, Louis!
Every word she utters is a lie!
I'm not joking! You should never believe what she says!
One day, she will betray you too!
She already has. I've just found out she's not my mother, Emma.
Good Outcome
You will not die by my hand today, Sarah.
She deserves to die.
In fact, I think that honor goes to you.
Bad Outcome
She should never have tried to shoot me...
Emma, no...
Don't move!
Louis, remember in Paris...
I trust you, son...
NOW, LOUIS!
No!
NO, DAMMIT!!
aaaaaahhh...
NO!! Why did you do that?
Louis...
No, no, NO!
Come on, Mother! Hang in there, you're gonna get through this!
Do not... trust him!
I am proud... of you... my son...
NO!!!
MOTHER!!!
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
Shoot Emma
It's just you and me now...
Let her go
Where is the Al Azif?
Sir Gregory planned to get it off the island by boat.
I wouldn't be surprised if he sends it with the next shipment for the continent. But I don't know when that is.
You manipulated us all!
You're going to pay!
What is at stake here far outweighs our personal interests, I'm...
Our "personal interests"??? You betrayed me!
Emily, no...
MINDREADER
What an idiot, he still doesn't get it.
It won't bring Emma back to life
It won't bring Emma back.
Don't let your anger get the better of you.
What do you mean, “you betrayed me”?
But...
Wait! How has Sarah betrayed you?
I don't believe it! You still don't get it!
I'm not Emily, stupid!
You went as far as killing your own sister!?
You're the one who pointed her out!
You only have yourself to blame!
And even after going to bed with her, you were incapable of telling us apart!
Oh dear God...!
Surprise, Sarah.
You can't just get rid of me like that, you old hag!
Do you realize what you did?
MIND READER
Oh, poor Louis, he's upset about me getting rid of his little sweetheart...
Why did you trick your sister?
Emma, you tricked your sister...
