You were afraid of my reaction
I wanted to tell you everything once you were old enough to understand.
Forgive me...
Louis, yes, I made mistakes in the past.
But now I'm ready to...
Do you consider me a mistake?
No, not you! You are what I am most proud of in my whole life!
You are good! You fight to do right! You are not like him!
Still, he is my Father!
Why did you steal me!
You don't want to know! Believe me!!
For once in your life be honest!
Why all this mess? Why do you have it in for him so much?
Why?
Because I'm his daughter!
I know what he's doing.
I see he has his eye on you. He's hovering around you, tempting you. He did it to me before you.
And if you don't live up to his expectations, he will cast you away.
Is that what happened to you?
I wasn't good enough for him so he rejected me.
What do you mean?
He tried to initiate me but it would seem I am unable to develop his talent. I can't withdraw my mind from my body.
I get it. The reason why you abducted me is because he didn't love you, isn't it?
He doesn't love anyone, Louis. Don't be taken in.
I forgive her
You are my mother.
Whatever you've done, I can't take that away from you.
It doesn't excuse everything, but in time we will find a way of putting it all behind us.
OhÂ ! Thank you, Louis.
Thank you! I will never lie to you again!
Come on, let's go.
No, Mother.
I'm not going back with you, I can't.
What do you mean? Louis, you can't stay here! He will...
Don't worry about me.
I have to stay. I still have a lot to learn.
But you go.
Louis...
I'll see you in Paris, don't worry.
Give her Piaggi's letter and her bag.
Here, this is yours...
Give her Piaggi's letter
Here, this is yours.
Give her back her bag
Here, take this. This is yours.
Keep everything
Don't forget, Louis. You've got the Lance. You can beat him!
If you hit him with it, he won't be able to escape from his mortal envelope and he will die with it.
I never want to see her again
You are going to take that boat and return to France.
I never want to see you again.
Louis, no! Don't say that!
Not after everything I've done for you!! You have no right...
MIND READER
You are mine!
You will never be free! I will find you and you will fall back into line! Like all your brothers and sisters.
Until you're ready to take him on!
Kill her!
Let her leave
Say farewell to her.
Farewell, Mother. Take care of yourself.
Drop dead
You're not my mother!!
You're crazy, woman!! I'll never be yours!!
You're not my mother!!
In spite of everything, she was right.
I'm a little mixed up... but I do understand your choice.
You were wrong not to speak to me about it before.
But I understand that you didn't want to leave me with him.
Oh thank you, Louis!
I promise never to lie to you again, my son.
Come, let's go home...
I can't.
What do you mean? Why not?
I've got to know.
Trust me.
We'll meet in Paris.
He wants you, Louis! He will never let you go!
Don't worry.
I really thought my next breath would be my last.
Well, anything's possible...
This is no time to be joking.
Just help me climb aboard this boat and let's get off of this cursed island.
No.
I'm not going anywhere, and neither are you, until you've told me everything.
For crying out loud, what are you talking about?
MIND READER
No, no, no! Not now, no! Make him not want to know!!
Mortimer is my father
Why have you never told me he's my Father?
Paris, 1763
Paris, 1763. Number 12, on rue des Martyrs.
Tell her you know
I know everything.
No...
I beg you, please trust me.
He's manipulating you... we must leave.
Paris.
Can't you see he wants you and he'll do anything to turn you against me...?
Number 12, on rue des Martyrs...
