What are you doing here?
You wouldn't have seen...
Mother!
No!
No! What's happened?
No, Mother! No!!
She's ruined my life, Louis.
I am sorry...
What were you thinking?
Emma meant everything to me.
Your mother destroyed everything by shooting her.
She was me and I was her!
MIND READER
Dear God, I beg you, make him kill me...
I've had enough of it all... I no longer have the strength in me...
I HAD TO SPEAK TO HER!!
I NEEDED TO TALK TO HER!!
She was going to tell me everything!!
I am sorry...
I did what Emma would have done.
But Sarah's not the one who killed Emma!
You're the one who killed Emma! Not my mother!!
And it wouldn't have happened if Sarah hadn't struck out at Emma first!
Kill her!
She was going to tell me everything!!
Get her out of my sight
Get out of here...
Why have you always lied to me?...
...
Why didn't you ever tell me I was his son?...
Oh, no, NO! Mother!
Louis!
It was accident, I'm sorry...
I didn't have a choice, she attacked me...
I... I didn't want to hurt her...
What happened?
I was on the wharf, it was dark,
She seemed to be preparing to depart.
I moved closer, I wanted us to talk but as soon as she saw me, she threatened me...
I wanted her to explain to me in her own words, what had happened to Emma.
I had to know what happened, Louis. You understand that, don't you?
MINDREADER
Is it really for him that you left me, Emily?
That's pathetic! Look, he still doesn't get it, for crying out loud...
Emma...
Oh, the bitch...
I want to be alone.
I'd like to be alone...
Please...
Right.
I'll leave you.
Kill her!
What did she say to you?
Did she say anything before she died?
I didn't understand everything, she was in a blind rage.
She pointed her pistol at me...
She spoke to me as if I were you and called me Louis.
She said you look so much like her and that she was so proud to have a son like you.
Did my mother say how proud she was to have me for a son?
That's right.
She's lying!
My mother would have never said that!
You're lying!!
Why, he does have a spine...!
So, Sarah couldn't be proud of her beloved son, huh? How in heavens would I know?
You're not Emily...
Surprise, little Louis!
It took you long enough, though!
Yes, you got it wrong... You didn't choose the right one!
She got even!
You wanted to get even for Emma's death!
You killed her! Admit it!!
Louis, stop, I swear that's what happened...
You are frightening me...
That's enough! Get out of here, Emily!
I never want to see you again!!
What exactly happened?
Tell me exactly what happened!
I told you.
I was on the other side of the wharf when she arrived. I wanted to get closer.
She was muttering to herself.
She was hurling abuse at Lord Mortimer.
When she saw me, she pulled out a pistol and pointed it at me.
I'm so sorry...
I'd like to be alone.
Of course.
I'm going up to the manor.
Emma!
You bitch!
What?
Louis, what's wrong with y...
No!!!
You are not Emily!!
Ah... that?
It took you long enough to figure it out, though.
I felt sorry for you when I saw you couldn't even recognize her, Louis.
What do you expect? It wasn't my fault.
Yes, you spent a night with her. She can't have made much of an impression on you.
Ah, men!
Shut it!
