No, no, no! Not now, no! Make him not want to know!!
Mortimer is my father
Why have you never told me he's my Father?
Paris, 1763
Paris, 1763. Number 12, on rue des Martyrs.
Tell her you know
I know everything.
No...
I beg you, please trust me.
He's manipulating you... we must leave.
Paris.
Can't you see he wants you and he'll do anything to turn you against me...?
Number 12, on rue des Martyrs...
He had to pay for what he did to me!
I panicked! There she was, with the baby due. I thought it was the right time to touch it but when...
To touch it?
By disemboweling her and stealing me from her?
The girl was already condemned to die. He never leaves any witnesses behind. She meant nothing to him.
And I absolutely had to find a way of stopping him.
MIND READER
I couldn't let him reproduce! I had to stop him propagating himself!
By stealing a baby?
Had you lost your mind or what?
How did you stop him by stealing a baby?
He was multiplying...
I had to do something! It took me years to pick up his trail again, Louis!
She stole my life from me!
You stole my life from me!
No, Louis. I gave you a life.
I offered you a choice! You got to know humanity. You are more human than many of us.
All you wanted was to wound him
You snatched a new born baby from its mother's womb, with the sole goal of seeking revenge!
From the second I took you in, I couldn't bear to be apart from you.
I looked after you, fed you, raised you, like a mother.
MIND READER
I am your mother.
She manipulated me.
You made me in your own image.
No, you're wrong!
It's true, you raised me.
I know...
You always took care of me.
I devoted my whole life to teaching you to distinguish between right and wrong.
So you would have the choice.
You are not like him!
B... but... but you never told me!
I wanted to.
I very nearly told you everything at least a dozen times.
You didn't, though. Did you?
Why?
I... I don't know, Louis...
MIND READER
I couldn't...
Not after Venice...
Lack of courage
You lacked the courage.
Yes, Louis.
Yes, I was wrong. I should have told you earlier!
I know! Forgive me! I beg you...
She would never have told me the truth
You never would have dared to tell me everything.
Yes!
I would have told you everything! I swear! But it wasn't easy, I wanted to choose the right time...
Venice!
Talk to me about Venice.
Oh no... I....
Louis, let's go. I'll tell you everything once we get home.
Now come!
You never wanted us to speak about it again.
Winter 1791, do you remember?
Louis, no. We agreed to never speak about it again.
Now I understand.
Drop it, Louis!
Venice, talk to me about Venice
We were on the trail of a businessman. We broke into his place, one night.
We ran into his wife...
Not that, Louis. It's in the past.
She too was pregnant.
Was he Mortimer's as well?
Louis, I...
Answer!
Yes.
Don't go there, Louis!
What did she do with the child?
What became of the child?
I gave it away.
For him too, you became his mother, didn't you?
No! I gave him to a couple who couldn't have children! I never saw him again!
How many children have you stolen from him?
I saved all of you, Louis.
I gave you a normal life!
MIND READER
Nine...
How many of us are there?
How many?
There are two of you.
I don't want to know.
Fear?
It was easier not to face up to it. Not to stir it all up.
Don't judge me, Louis.
