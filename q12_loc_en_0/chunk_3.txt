You go to hell!
LEAVE HER
You shot her in cold blood!
What is at stake here far outweighs our personal interests, I should...
Our "personal interests"??? I'm talking about my sister's life!
She was my other half!!
Calm down, Emily! Calm down!
Louis, don't come near me!
I warned you what would happen if I found her!
She may as well kill the bitch! It doesn't matter now!
You can go ahead and kill her, I don't care any more!
Louis, please. Don't think you can play me for a fool!
She's not my mother, Emily.
She abducted me at birth and spent her life telling me lies.
So go right ahead and shoot her. You'd be doing me a favour.
Louis! No! You're wrong!
I never wanted this!
You've always lied to me...
Persuade her not to shoot.
MIND READER
I was so hoping it wouldn't end like this...
I'm fed up with all these deaths...
Lower your arm.
Emily... Put the weapon down.
She... she has to pay for all the harm she's done to me.
Well, to be fair, we've all made mistakes.
And look at her, Emily. She's paid for hers.
I'm all alone now...
Sarah didn't kill Emma.
Emily, you know full well that it wasn't Sarah who killed Emma.
If it weren't for her, none of this would have happened!
Maybe. But you can't accuse her of this murder.
You're the one who fired, Emily.
Shut up!!!
Louis... you had better choose your words a little more carefully, don't you think?
No one's going to die here.
Listen, Emily, we've all gone through some horrible experiences since we arrived here.
I can assure you, we'd all rather be somewhere else.
She betrayed my sister...
She has to pay, Louis.
We've had enough people die here, don't you think?
Look at her, Emily. Don't you think she's paid enough?
But... I...
You are not a murderer.
Emily, calm down.
You're not like them.
You're not a murderer!
Is that so? And what do you think we were doing for the Order, then?
And for the crown of England? Why do you think the Order contacted me?
Silent! Methodical! No one ever suspected us! We always covered for each other!
Duchess, I am sorry for what happened.
I didn't have any choice...
Ah, you! Shut your mouth!
You had a choice alright!!
You use people according to your own desires, without any scruples!
Excuse me, Duchess, but we're in the same line of business!
Shut it!
And as for Emma, she knew only too well!
No, Emily! Look at me!
Emily!
What did you say?
MIND READER
No! I'm not like her! And never will be!!
Look at me!!
Look at me!!
Say that again!
LOOK AT ME, EMILY!
Emma knew the risks of the job only too well!
You're constantly risking your life to serve the Order.
You knew the risks involved!
We were supposed to rely on our own people, Sarah.
You were her superior in the Order, she trusted you!
If Sarah must die, I must be by MY hand!
Emily! No! If she has to die, it will be by MY hand!
That bitch lied to me all my life, Emily!
Louis... What's...
Shut up!
You lied to me!!
What are you talking about?
If she has to die, I'm the one who's gonna do it!
Louis, no...
What did he tell you?
You are not like Sarah!
You're not like her!
Neither you nor Emma are like Sarah.
Ever since you got here, you've always tried to help me.
I trust you, Emily.
And Emma would never have betrayed me, either.
No, she...she wasn't like that.
She was loyal.
Don't make the same mistake again!
Emily! No! Don't let your anger control you again!
We both know very well what happened in your room, with Emma...
Whose fault was that, Louis?
Who found nothing better to do than come between us?
Who!!
I'm sorry.
But why did Sarah betray Emma?
Why?!
I... Your sister was supposed to hide something!
