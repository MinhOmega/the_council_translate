That is a personal matter, monsieur!
Yes, that is true. So, tell me.
Alright, it was passion! That's why we couldn't stay together. It scared her.
I know enough... 
Learn more about Elizabeth's tattoos.
Did you see how many tattoos Miss Adams had on her?
Of course. Who wouldn't have noticed?
Yes, but I'm sure that an expert like yourself must have an opinion on the subject.
I do. She was seeking to imprison something inside her. Her own body had become a sort of...  prison.
She wanted to protect herself, is that what you're saying?
Elizabeth was a flame. A candle in the night.
And like all candles in the night, she was surrounded by darkness, by her demons. Call it what you will.
One thing is for sure, she struggled against hell and high water not to let her flame go out.
Leave
We finished. I'll have a look around and then take my leave.
Do whatever you have to do.
Good day, Monsieur de Richet.
Mr Wöllner...  are you looking for anything in particular? Next to Elizabeth's room?
I...  I...  No...  no, I...  nothing special... 
Insinuate that he looks dodgy.
I'd have thought...  This is not really the shortest way to get to your suite.
Yes...  I...  I wasn't really looking where I was going.
Speak about Elizabeth's death.
Has anyone told you that Elizabeth was killed last night?
I...  Yes...  rumors spread quickly... 
He looks very put out... 
It's...  it's horrible...  how did it happen?
I can say nothing to you, sir...  You'd better follow your host's instructions and stay in your quarters.
Don't tell him anything for the time being
You ought to go back to your room, as Lord Mortimer asked you to... 
And may I know why you yourself are not in your quarters?
For very sad reasons, sir, which only concern Lord Mortimer, the only person I'm accountable to.
Well, look at you, the new right-hand man...  I see.
What is he doing in the corridor?
Lord Mortimer must have informed you of the necessity for everyone to remain in their rooms until further notice... 
Certainly, but I'm a guest, not a prisoner!
I was looking for a servant since we don't all, unfortunately, have one at our disposal!
Yeah right!
I shall leave you now, sir. I will return to my room!

The Sorrows of Young Werther.
There's a handwritten text signed by Von Wöllner on this first page:
"Dear Elizabeth, I know that this book is but a small token compared to the delightful moments you gave me.
But I hope that this will nonetheless keep the memory alive. Your ever obedient servant."
So, Wöllner had a relationship with Elizabeth... 
But that's hardly surprising given his fondness for the occult.

You have cleared your name in the eyes of your guests
I failed to convince the judges of my innocence
I understood what my mother's message is about
I did not understand my mother's message
I discovered my mother's message
I searched Lord Mortimer's study
I could have searched Lord Mortimer's study
I got myself executed
I managed to access the derelict room
I found all the correspondence between my mother and E.
I could have found the conversation between my mother and her partner
I made myself even more suspicious in the eyes of Sir Holm
I convinced Lord Mortimer of the culpability of a suspect
I refused to indicate a culprit to Lord Mortimer
I did not convince Lord Mortimer of the culpability of my suspect
I denounced a suspect without the slightest piece of evidence against them
Lord Mortimer's office
January 22nd, 1793
William, I would like to see you a moment before we begin.
In private... 
Let's step outside a moment... 
Louis, this will only take a few moments... 
Search the study
Alright, let's take this chance to look around.
Wait
I'd better not make myself look more suspicious than I already do.
