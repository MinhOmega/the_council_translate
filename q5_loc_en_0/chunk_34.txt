Two representations of the same saint... 
Saint Paul is the only saint to be presented twice in these paintings, contrary to the other apostles.
How come?
The myth of Saint Paul is well known.
Examine the frame.
This painting has been hanging here for a long time, a lot of dust has built up on it.
A finger has drawn a number in the thin layer of dust.
I can read the number...  4.

Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, by Caravaggio.
Examine the painting
Caravaggio attained a magnificent command of black, and the play of colors too.
Paul facing an ordeal. The curtain of his illusions is being raised, and he receives the light from his savior.
I remember this story.
A fierce opponent of the first Christians, Saint Paul is suddenly struck by the call of Jesus Christ, and converts.
It's the best known conversion in Christian history, which teaches us that even enemies of Christ can be saved.
And even become his greatest apostles after finding Faith.
From what I can recall, the account of his conversion can be found in the Epistles to the Galatians, the Philippians, the Corinthians and the Acts of the Apostles.

Please, sit back down, Louis.
This sort of behaviour is not working in your favour, young man.
Good evening, Monsieur de Richet.
Likewise, Sir Gregory... 
Well then, let us begin...
