But do go on... 
I refused to go on drinking with her.
She already seemed drunk and her conversation became confused.
So then she ordered me to get out.
If only I had stayed... 
Don't blame yourself, Louis, how you could you have known?
But thank you for this new information.
Is there nothing you want to say, Louis?
... 
It wasn't me, I...  I didn't kill her.
I'd much rather have met you under different circumstances.
Lord Mortimer, believe me, I am very conscious of the gravity of the situation.
... 
Everything seems to point to me as the one who killed Elizabeth, but I swear I am innocent.
Out of repsect for your mother, rest assured that I do want to believe you.
And all I want is to be able to prove it to you.
When do we start?
We already have.
Tell me, Louis...  how do you feel?
Silly question.
My Lord, don't take this the wrong way but what do you mean by a question like that?
You find me unconscious in front of Miss Adams' body, and you ask me how I feel?
I am very serious, Louis. I'm concerned for you.
Slightly...  lost
I feel a bit disoriented... 
Hmhm, that's only normal in your situation.
You can hardly say you've been left unscathed lately.
First, the disappearance of your mother. And now this murder.
Trapped like a rat.
I feel like I'm a rat trapped in a maze... 
Interesting.
I beg your pardon?
Sarah also felt like she was trapped, like an animal.
Where are you going with this, my Lord?
Sarah's behavior grew odd before her disappearance.
Her attitude changed, she became prey to outbursts of violence and a number of temporary absences.
I'm just trying to make sure that you don't go getting lost like your mother did.
You're not suggesting that I might have killed Elizabeth and that I don't remember, are you?
I don't know, Louis. It's just that what with your mother, and now you, it's rather a lot... 
The more I take stock of the situation, the more I'm under the impression that you've been set up.
But before going any further, I must inform you that Sir Gregory is about to arrive.
He is coming to question you about the murder of poor Elizabeth, whom he was very fond of.
He is quite determined to find the culprit, whomever they may be.
So convince him of your innocence, then we can continue this conversation.
Enclosed are the witness statements of guests Bonaparte and Hillsborrow.
Statement of Napoleon Bonaparte:
When asked, "What were you doing yesterday evening?", Monsieur Bonaparte replied:
"After talking with Lord Mortimer, I spent the evening playing cards with Sir Gregory, Mr Washington and his Eminence Piaggi.
Sir Gregory won".
When asked, "Did you notice anything strange throughout the evening?", Monsieur Bonaparte replied:
"At daybreak, I thought I saw someone on the balcony but couldn't see who it was"
Statement of Duchess Hillsborrow:
When asked, "What were you doing yesterday evening?", the Duchess replied:
“I spent the evening in Monsieur de Richet's company. We admired the works exhibited in the Manor Gallery.
While going up to bed, we ran into Miss Adams.
As I was tired, I left Monsieur de Richet and Miss Adams in conversation and went to bed."
When asked, "Did you notice anything strange throughout the evening?", the Duchess replied:
"No, not that I remember."

Several portraits of apostles, all signed by Guido Reni.
Looks like someone touched this commode recently, there are finger prints on the sheets and in the dust.

There are fragments of burnt papers in the chimney.
There is a legible fragment left, Hey, I recognize my mother's handwriting.
She says : "We must find a safer way to communicate: someone is onto us. Trust in my faith in the man with the sword."
So Mother had an accomplice here...  who could it be?
Who could she be suspicious of?
I must find the next part... Faith, a man with a sword, I recognize her love of riddles there!

“I must go beyond the Nightmare”... 
What does she mean by that?
It's probably allegorical
I'm guessing it's a metaphor.
I need to figure out what this means.
Mortimer is getting his guests together, I ought to join them so I don't look suspicious.
It's probably literal
