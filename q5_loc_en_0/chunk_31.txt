It probably has to do with an object or something... 
It's a place
It must surely speak of a place.
It's a concept
Well, if it's a concept, I've got no idea what it is…
Granting that this is the case, where might it be found?
A ground floor room
A first floor room
A second floor room
Outside the manor
Try to remember
... was a study, I'm practically sure of it.

Well, let's see if Mortimer has anything to hide behind his painting!

What does she mean by that?
It's probably allegorical
I'm guessing it's a metaphor.
I need to figure out what this means.

So much for discretion!
Pick the lock
Open sesame... 
Use the disk
