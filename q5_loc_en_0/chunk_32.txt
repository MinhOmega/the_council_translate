Force open the door
So much for discretion!
Pick the lock
Open sesame... 
Use the disk
Let's see if it works... 
It's open!
How do you open it?
I'm gonna need something to help me get the key that fell on the floor.
The door was closed from the inside...  would Mother have provided something within reach to recover it?
Leave
Observe the painting
It's Saint John, painted by Guido Reni.
Scrutinize the frame
The painting looks like it's been taken down recently.
What was it my mother said? That she would wait for an answer, hidden behind the apostle.
Ah, of course! There's something written behind the painting!
“On the second day, the pilgrims will listen to the prophecy of the young apostle.”
“They shall add one companion to their left and three to their right to complete their rank.”
... what does it mean?
What do I know about this apostle?
That's right, Saint John is often credited with writing about the Apocalypse in the last book of the Bible.
He's also known as the youngest of Christ's apostles.
Saint John is known as the youngest of Christ's apostles.
We often give credit to Saint John for having written about the Apocalypse, in the last book of the Bible.
He doesn't have a beard... 
Saint John is the only apostle painted in this gallery who hasn't got a beard.
Think about the code
Think about the figures
“They should add a companion to their left and three to their right to complete their ranks.”
I imagine it applies to their code? The one Mother set up with the pilgrims?
What's this? A group of pilgrims who Paul was talking to...  and now John is telling them prophecies?
Remember the aforementioned Book
“On the second day, the pilgrims listened to the prophecy of the young apostle.”
The prophecy of the young apostle...  that was John. And the prophecy mentioned, is most likely the Book of Revelations according to Saint John.
Go back
Leave
Hey, wait! That means it's him, he's the youngest apostle!
Right, this painting is therefore associated with the answer which “E” had to give to my mother.
Now I just need to know how to recover the answer...

What is this disk?
Observe the disk
Oh, that reminds me of the ones my mother collects.
It's magnetic.
Take it
Leave it

Observe the painting
Painting of Saint Mark, from the collection of the apostles by Guido Reni.
Look at the frame
There's nothing worth noticing here.
Inspect the surroundings.
Scrutinize the chest of drawers.
Little characters are engraved on the chest of drawers, under the urn.
It's a sentence in Hebrew.
I know what that means.
It says "Count in the dust".
Alright. Let's do it.
Why in Hebrew?
Choosing the Hebrew alphabet is no coincidence. It's...  it's got to be a reference to the Bible.
Leave
Inspect the dusty piece of furniture.
There are finger marks, deliberately drawn in the dust...  8 in all.
That's what the message in Hebrew spoke about! Hebrew, 8.
Examine the candlestick
No...  nothing of value here.
