Someone saw you not far from the victim's room. Can you tell me what you were doing exactly, please?
I can tell you that "someone" is an idiot.
I wanted to warn her to be careful. You see, on the night of my arrival I saw someone leaving her room in haste.
And I wanted to speak to her, to warn her. Unfortunately, the young lady slipped through my fingers each time.
Now I know why. She had every reason to be worried.
What an idiot I was not to insist! I could have helped her!
Did you recognize the prowler?
Were you able to recognize the prowler?
Unfortunately not, no. It was dark and Lord Mortimer was waiting for me. I was not really paying attention, anyway.
Not a single detail?
Excuse me for insisting but if you saw him or her, I'm sure you would have more information than that.
It's just that you don't think it can be of help to me.
What do you mean?
I don't know. Was it a woman, for instance? Bearing in mind that all the women here, wear whalebone dresses, which is rather noticeable.
A man, I should say. I don't recall seeing the silhouette of a dress.
You see, you saw many things, in fact.
Hang on, laissez moi réflechir, let me think a minute.
A wig? His height? The sound of his footsteps, maybe?
Ah, his height! Oui, somewhat imposing. A tall man, and straight. As for the rest, I don't know, Monsieur de Richet.
Not to worry. That's already quite a lot. Thank you for everything
The night of her arrival...
But if I remember rightly, the night of her arrival was also the night of MY arrival.
So the person he saw leaving Elizabeth's room...
... was Washington!
Continue...
Is he sincere?
I've been studying him for a while now and I don't think he was lying.
Yet, I'm surprised how easy it was for me to read him. Must surely be his military side.
I wish they all could be like that. My investigation would be finished already.

Leave
Well, have we finished, monsieur?
Exactly. Thanks again for all your answers. Good day.
Monsieur de Richet. Please be quick, we are both very busy.
Question him over last night.
Did you hear about young Elizabeth?
Indeed. It is deeply regrettable.
Lord Mortimer asked me to...
I know. You no doubt want to know my alibi.
I spent the night downstairs playing cards.
Who with?
Can you tell me who was present at the game, please?
Well...  There were Lord Mortimer, President Washington and Sir Gregory.
Thank you.
Ah! And his Eminence Piaggi as well. Excuse me, I nearly forgot him, poor soul.
Did anyone leave early?
Did any of you leave during the game?
Not that I know of, monsieur.
I didn't exactly spend my time noting the other guests comings and goings, but I don't think so.
Thank you.
Did anything happen out of the ordinary?
Did you notice anything unusual during the evening?
Nothing at all, except the luck of the devil of Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory at cards.
Did they win much?
Ohlala, monsieur, they cleaned us out, more like! But I plan on getting it all back before we leave.
Until what time?
What time did the game end?
I can't say exactly.
As for me, I must have stayed until midnight.
I was exhausted, couldn't think straight. So I preferred to go up to bed.
On your way up to bed, did you notice anything out of the ordinary?
No, not in the least. The whole manor was sound asleep.
Not really, no...
Never mind...
Does he own a pistol?
As any good soldier would, I imagine you own a firearm. May I see it?
Oh, well, if you really want to, here is my pistol. Don't worry, it is not loaded.
Do you have several of these?
In Corsica, oui, but not on me when I am traveling. Only a bandit would carry such an arsenal.
Thank you.
He was seen lurking around Elizabeth's room.
