Well, have we finished, monsieur?
Exactly. Thanks again for all your answers. Good day.
It looks like a note between Emily and Washington about trade deals.
decipher the letter
The English and the Americans are preparing a peace treaty... 
It would appear that Emily is in secret discussions with Washington about reopening trade between the United States and England.
If such an arrangement came into being, France would suffer dearly.

Duchess,
You can inform King George of the Holy Father's backing.
We shall assist you with financing the recruitment of regiments of emigrant royalists to fight against France.
Your friend,
His Eminence, Giuseppe Piaggi

There's just one holster in Bonaparte's gear.
And the pistol is missing. On the other hand, his cleaning equipment is in mint condition.
That's typical of the soldier in him.

"I don't know if we shall meet again. At this point in time I am a prisoner, snared by my own decisions.
You must be protected. My future is lost without you, you can still be saved.
No matter how much bitterness you hold against me, you must know that I made a pact with the devil who I thought I could master... 
I thought I knew the monsters, but what I did for France is nothing compared to what they are capable of doing!
Now I can't see any way out, the jaws are closing upon me.
I love you now and forever."

Your Eminence.
I imagine that you've heard the news about Miss Adams?
What a tragedy, my son! How could such a thing have happened?
That's exactly what I'm trying to find out. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary last night?
I saw the young French soldier, Bonaparte, I believe, hanging around near Miss Adams' room.
But I would not want to get an innocent man into trouble, Louis. It's probably nothing.
Does he know why?
Not to worry, your Eminence. If he is innocent, then he has nothing to fear.
Do you know why Monsieur Bonaparte was hanging around her room like that?
Well, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that a dashing, young soldier had become infatuated with a fragile young woman, who looked a bit lost... 
But I don't think he got a very warm welcome.
Bonaparte and Adams? But they didn't even know each other, did they?
I couldn't say, Louis.
Anything else?
But if I were you, my son, I would talk to Monsieur Péru.
You remember how violently he set upon Miss Adams.
Oh, don't worry, he's on the list of suspects.
One last thing, you must know that Péru hit young Adams on the evening of our arrival.
He apparently violently attacked her in the small salon.
Do you know anything else about the attack?
Oh, unfortunately not. I arrived too late to intervene. Young Miss Adams had already been submitted to the foul lout's wrath.
Otherwise, you can believe me, it would not have happened!
What can I do for you, de Richet?
Monsieur, Lord Mortimer has appointed me to investigate the tragedy that befell us last night.
Oh, yes, it's horrible, yes.
How can I help, monsieur?
Where was he last night?
Where were you last night?
In my room. I read a few ancient manuscripts before going to bed, but I didn't stay up long. I was tired.
Thank you kindly.
I know they had a relationship.
Excuse me for asking, but did you know Miss Adams?
Oh, she...  er...  not really, to tell the truth. No.
I found the Werther dedication, signed by your hand, monsieur. Would you like to change your version now?
Be careful, de Richet! Don't push your luck!
My relationship with Miss Adams was pure and has nothing to do with you.
Continue playing the detective as you see fit, but if I find the bastard who did that to Elizabeth, I will... 
Yes, I would have preferred a simple response, but I see I have my answer now... 
How long did your relationship last?
Exactly how long had you been seeing her?
I have no reason to answer you.
I see, is that what you want me to tell Lord Mortimer when he asks what I've found out?
It's...  it's only been a few weeks!
Was your relationship over?
I get the impression that your romance was over. Am I right?
So? What does it matter to you? I would never have attacked her, if that's what you're insinuating!
Who put an end to the relationship? You or her?
It was her! It was her. But what does that matter, we both agreed.
Did you love her?
You loved her, didn't you?
That is none of your damn business!
Your feelings betray you, sir.
So what! Yes, I loved her, like a moth loves the flame of a candle!
That's why we could never be together!
The nature of your relationship!
Please, tell me a little more about the nature of your relationship.
