"He's coming"...  "The demon is upon me"
"He's coming back to kill me...  there she is!"
"Death has come to finish me off, I've just run into her son"
That was her last entry...  what tortured writing... 
Use your knowledge
It's medieval Latin. I know enough enough to translate a bit.

Let's get out of here.
A piece of fabric, high quality at that: I'd say it's silk...
Going by the texture and the gray hue it must come from a dress, that kind that women of quality wear.
For the nobility clothes make the man...  or the woman...
It's a travel dress, the silk has been lightly waxed to protect it from bad weather...
And I know the very woman who came up with the idea, given all the traveling she does: my mother...
God help us! Why did she come here in the first place?
The material appears to have undergone abnormal wear and tear...  she must have been scouring the countryside and that doesn't look good...
Let's see what it reminds me of...
The color doesn't correspond to Emily's black outfits, and Elizabeth doesn't have anything quite like this in her wardrobe...
Let's take a closer look...
It's a little dirty...  It must come from the bottom of the dress where it touches the ground...
I recognize that moiré pattern: it's the same as the travel dress my mother was wearing when she left!
But why the hell did she come into this room?

A pistol, fairly new I'd say... and judging by the weight of it, fairly light... 
Examine the firearm
A tribute engraved on the barrel... 
"To the liberators of France"
Observe the grip
Mmm...  There's a few dried traces of blood on the grip.
Difficult to know for sure how they got there... 
Check inside the barrel
It's extremely well maintained, the barrel is perfectly clean... 
It isn't loaded and there's no traces of gunshot residue... 
I conclude that it hasn't been used recently.

Right, I shall have to find its owner...

Monsieur de Richet. Please be quick, we are both very busy.
Question him over last night.
Did you hear about young Elizabeth?
Indeed. It is deeply regrettable.
Lord Mortimer asked me to...
I know. You no doubt want to know my alibi.
I spent the night downstairs playing cards.
Who with?
Can you tell me who was present at the game, please?
Well...  There were Lord Mortimer, President Washington and Sir Gregory.
Thank you.
Ah! And his Eminence Piaggi as well. Excuse me, I nearly forgot him, poor soul.
Did anyone leave early?
Did any of you leave during the game?
Not that I know of, monsieur.
I didn't exactly spend my time noting the other guests comings and goings, but I don't think so.
Thank you.
Did anything happen out of the ordinary?
Did you notice anything unusual during the evening?
Nothing at all, except the luck of the devil of Lord Mortimer and Sir Gregory at cards.
Did they win much?
Ohlala, monsieur, they cleaned us out, more like! But I plan on getting it all back before we leave.
Until what time?
What time did the game end?
I can't say exactly.
As for me, I must have stayed until midnight.
I was exhausted, couldn't think straight. So I preferred to go up to bed.
On your way up to bed, did you notice anything out of the ordinary?
No, not in the least. The whole manor was sound asleep.
Not really, no...
Never mind...
Does he own a pistol?
As any good soldier would, I imagine you own a firearm. May I see it?
Oh, well, if you really want to, here is my pistol. Don't worry, it is not loaded.
Do you have several of these?
In Corsica, oui, but not on me when I am traveling. Only a bandit would carry such an arsenal.
Thank you.
He was seen lurking around Elizabeth's room.
