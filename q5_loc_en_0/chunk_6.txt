The label shows that  this laudanum comes straight from America.
I wonder if Washington's involved?
Laudanum?
Large quantities can knock out a bull.
Could Elizabeth have been drugged?
If the body wounds are anything to go by, then clearly not. She put up a fierce fight.

Vials of Laudanum... 
Take a look at the vials

The clock stopped at 3:54.
If it was smashed during the murder, then I've just established the time of the crime.
That would clear Emily de facto, because she was still with me at the time.

A pentagram.
What the hell's been going on here?
Examine the symbol
Contrary to what most people believe, a pentagram is not there to conjure up I don't know what evil, or demonic creature.
With the point toward the top, the pentagram is an ancient symbol of protection against evil.
I remember Mother's books.
Many esoteric rituals are based on this shape.
Could Elizabeth have been sacrificed during an occult ritual?
What's the connection with Elizabeth's death?
I wonder if Elizabeth's death has anything at all to do with this pentagram.
If a ritual went wrong and degenerated, Elizabeth would probably have been killed in the center of the pentagram.
Not three meters from here...  That's strange...

The talisman that I gave back to Elizabeth...  Can't exactly say it brought her good luck.

The blade
The blade is short and thin. Well sharpened, apparently.
It's covered in blood, still fresh... 
The handle
The lower part of the handle is unsullied by blood.
The murderer gripped the weapon so tight that there's no blood where he held it.
The hand print indicates a small and slender hand... 
Analyze the knife
The hand print on the handle is really small.
I can't imagine a man with a hand that size...  It must be from a woman's hand.
Stand aside

The windows are closed from the inside.
So the assassin didn't go through there. At least, not to leave the premises.

A knocked over bottle of wine... 
Smell
*sniff* What kind of plonk is that? Hey, it's a Bordeaux...  That's a Château Haut-Brion, that's a great wine... 
*sniff* Pwah!!! Same thing Elizabeth served me last night...  Still just as disgusting... 
I don't know what's happened to this wine but it's undrinkable.
Analyze the smell
I know that smell. It's laudanum. It must have been mixed with the wine directly in the bottle.

Has Sir finished with this room?
Yes
I know enough now, thank you.
Very well, sir. Sir may return whenever need be, I shall guard the door.
No
No, I haven't gone over everything yet.
Sir may take his time. When Sir would like to leave, Sir has only to tell me.
Who made such a mess of this room?
