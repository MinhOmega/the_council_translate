Behind the painting
It's too cumbersome for me to unhook here, but judging by the dust, it hasn't been moved for months, if not years!
Move away
Leave
Observe the painting
Painting of Saint Mark, from the collection of the apostles by Guido Reni.
Look at the frame
There's nothing worth noticing here.
Inspect the surroundings.
Scrutinize the chest of drawers.
Little characters are engraved on the chest of drawers, under the urn.
It's a sentence in Hebrew.
I know what that means.
It says "Count in the dust".
Alright. Let's do it.
Why in Hebrew?
Choosing the Hebrew alphabet is no coincidence. It's...  it's got to be a reference to the Bible.
Leave
Inspect the dusty piece of furniture.
There are finger marks, deliberately drawn in the dust...  8 in all.
That's what the message in Hebrew spoke about! Hebrew, 8.
Examine the candlestick
No...  nothing of value here.

Observe the painting
A drawing of the apostle Mathew, painted by Guido Reni.
He's represented as writing the Word of the Lord, transmitted by the Holy Spirit...  who appears here in the guise of an angel.
Look at the frame
There's something else behind this painting...
It says: "Half of each group will join the first city of Corinth."
What the hell does that mean?
Think about the town quoted.
It must be the group of pilgrims mentioned from before. I guess maybe the city of Corinth is a reference to the Epistle from Corinthians in the Bible.
Think about the group of pilgrims
The group of pilgrims...  if I'm not mistaken, numbered respectively 12 and 14 in the last painting.
With the simple operation suggested, that would mean that the new groups are 6 and 7.

Saint Paul, painted by Guido Reni
Inspect the painting
Saint Paul is shown holding a sword.
Strange, there's hardly any dust, as if the painting's been cleaned recently... 
There's a small inscription engraved on the frame.
Let's take a closer look...  “This is how Paul spoke to his pilgrims from Rome.”
Just above that, someone's written down the figure 11 on the painting, and underlined it twice!
I don't know what does that mean?
Two faces of the same saint?
Strange, Saint Paul is shown twice, unlike the other disciples.
He is not an evangelist.
Of the 4 apostles shown in this piece, Paul is the only one who isn't an evangelist. He is the thirteenth apostle.
Think about the secret code
So we have...  the figure 11, twice underlined.
And a story of a group of pilgrims, who it looks like Paul is speaking to.
Maybe it's a code, there must be a connexion. A text on Paul must be somewhere, and it must be associated with the figure 11.
But what's the story with these pilgrims? I mean...  A connection with the figure maybe?

Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, by Caravaggio.
Examine the painting
Caravaggio attained a magnificent command of black, and the play of colors too.
Paul facing an ordeal. The curtain of his illusions is being raised, and he receives the light from his savior.
I remember this story.
A fierce opponent of the first Christians, Saint Paul is suddenly struck by the call of Jesus Christ, and converts.
It's the best known conversion in Christian history, which teaches us that even enemies of Christ can be saved.
And even become his greatest apostles after finding Faith.
From what I can recall, the account of his conversion can be found in the Epistles to the Galatians, the Philippians, the Corinthians and the Acts of the Apostles.
