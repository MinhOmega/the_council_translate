Bring up the Holy Lance
Hard to kill time on this island. Nothing ever happens. Gets a bit boring, don't you think?
Are you joking, my friend? I'm sure you're just being ironic.
Yes and no... It's true that the manor is full of books and works of art.
Unfortunately, the subjects are restricted to Lord Mortimer's specific tastes: the crusades, religion...
Yes, that's true.
By the way, have you noticed the representations of the Holy Lance he's got all over the place?
Ah no... it was the last thing on my mind to be honest.
Oh... Well, that's a pity, I would have enjoyed chatting about it, as I would have done with my mother.
Ask him directly what he knows about the Holy Lance.
I'm back on the trail of my mother again.
I don't have time to explain, but would you know anything about the Holy Lance?
I... Ah! That's good news, but be careful, Louis. You might end up getting noticed...
Do you know anything or not?
No, I regret I don't... But why not ask von Wöllner? Theology is his field after all.
That's an idea... In that case, I'll try and find him.
You are keeping up the good work, I see... but I'm telling you, keep your guard up. Everyone is rather on edge right now...
You're right... thanks for everything, Mr President.
See you later.
So... let's see what Wöllner has in his bookcase...
Inspect the books
A few works on religions...
Two scientific essays about human thought...
Most of these works are on Alchemy.
"Longini militis fabulam"...
Ah!... what have we here?
It looks like a kind of biography on Longinus the centurion.
Truly, Wöllner has done everything he can to get information about that Lance.
Understand the titles of the books
Not surprising, most of these works are in German.
And one in Latin...  "Longini militis fabulam".
Analyze the works
Oh damnit, most of these works are in German... I don't understand a thing.
Except for this one. Looks like Latin: "Longini militis fabulam".
Longini ?
Inspect in detail
I don't know where to begin, I've... I've never heard of most of these works.
I'd better keep this one, though.
