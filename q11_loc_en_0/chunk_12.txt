I want to know how she managed to open it
Wait! I've got to know what I did wrong!
That is one fearsome mechanism.
In fact, if I hadn't watched you beforehand I would never have found the right combination.
Tell me... where did I go wrong?
First, the nails
The three nails. Yes, it's true... They let you open the iris...
Yes, but you still need to find the right theme, don't you? The fresco was a trap.
Apart from the fresco, everything pointed to the Crucifixion. The things that make it possible to activate the mechanism are associated with the crucifixion.
The cross to activate the mechanism and the nails to choose a date.
Then the iris
What did you do once you uncovered the iris?
I matched the icon of the crown of thorns with the town of Golgotha where the Crucifixion took place...
And the end?
... Well... How did you manage to crack the puzzle?
Then I had to link the crown of thorns to the wheel that showed the date of the crucifixion, according to the Exegesis...
But I failed to understand the first time... With that theme in mind, I chose 26M which represents the 26th of March...
To conclude, I had to use the armillary sphere to find the moon corresponding to the day of the crucifixion, which turned out to be in the first quarter...
All that was left to do was to linkall those elements on the same axis.
I know the first...
Damn, I was sure I had figured out how the lock worked...
Of course, Louis... But you still had to choose the right theme from the start.
It was the crucifixion... I matched its symbol, the crown of thorns, to the place where Christ was nailed to the cross, Golgotha.
I know the first and the second...
But... but I had linked the theme of the crucifixion to its date, its place and its symbol...
You know, I didn't do any better than you on the first go...
And it took two failures to get it right! You needed the middle disk of the lunar calendar, I think...
Let's get through the door
Come on!
My precipitation has already cost me dearly....
Yes... But even so, we haven't time to feel sorry for ourselves, let's not waste another minute, Louis !
The cardinal's not in his room...
I bet he went back to stuffing himself.

Let's have a look at these personal papers...
Let's see if they mention the Holy Lance.
No, nothing here... Just a diplomatic correspondence.
Ah... here... A list.
Of course, it's in Latin, the language of the Church.
Thank you , Mother, for teaching me this language...
All those hours of learning Latin declensions are gonna pay off in the end! Mother will be proud!
Now, this could be interesting... Lanceae sanctae... Various representation criteria, of which are shown the most common throughout the centuries, and in different forms.
If Piaggi's notes are anything to go by, the weapon I'm looking for is shaped like a tapered spear. That should help me identify it.
I'm not able to translate these notes.
Damnit ! I should have followed my mother's advice and spent more time studying the classics!

I must find the Holy Lance
Using the exegesis, I was able to deduce that the lance is made of copper...
According to Wöllner's information, the lance is copper-rimmed...
The exegesis mentions a shiny metal...
I read that the lance should be shiny, but it can't be gold because Longinus was just a simple centurion...
I deduced from the Bible that part of the lance is made of copper...
Wöllner spoke about the golden lance of Longinus...
Piaggi told me it was the shape of a boar spear...
Piaggi said it was in the shape of a leaf.
Piaggi said it was in the shape of a leaf, but I don't think he was telling the truth.
In the painting of Longinus I noticed that it had the shape of a spear...
I noticed on the painting of Longinus that it had the shape of a spear, which is what Mortimer's opinion confirmed.
The statue of Longinus shows it in the shape of a leaf...
By translating Piaggi's notes, I learned that it was shaped like a spear...
I noticed a discreet fish symbol engraved on the tip of the lance of the Longinus' statue...
In the biography of Longinus the centurion, the lance is described as being engraved with the symbol of a fish on the tip...

Flavius Aetius...
Inspect the sarcophagus
It was cut a long time ago, you can tell by the rough hacks of the tool and the patina of the stone...
This sarcophagus is very ancient, I'd say it's several centuries old...
The vanquisher of the Catalaunian Plains
I remember : he was the Roman general who defeated Attila and his hordes in the terrible battle of the Catalaunian Plains...
I was once taught something about this man...
Flavius Aetius, the one they call the last of the Romans...
He was assassinated by his own emperor, who was jealous of all his victories.
But how did he end up here?
Move back
