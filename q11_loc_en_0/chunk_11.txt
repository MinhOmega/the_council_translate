What's the matter?
Why did you shoot Emily's sister?
Do you really think now is the right time for this?
Insist, goddammit!
I want to know, Mother!
Why did you betray her?
Listen, Louis, I don't think you've really understood my interest in the Al Azif... It's not just simple curiosity about some old relic!
You tried to kill her!
And I had no choice, for crying out loud! It must not fall into the hands of the demons or we are all doomed, don't you see?!
Listen, I don't know exactly what it contains but I prefer to be one step ahead!
If they want it, there must be a reason, and even if I don't know what it is, I want to stop them for safety's sake, no matter what!
Nothing will stop you if I understand correctly, not even...
Enough, Louis! If you could see the extent of their power as I do, then you would understand what I'm saying!
Don't insist, Louis...
Don't insist
Alright... we'll do it your way...
One more thing... if they find you in possession of the Lance, they won't let you get away with it.
Choose only one and hide it under your jacket so you don't get caught with it! Then, run and meet me on the wharf!
And if I get caught?
If they catch you in possession of the Lance, we're all doomed!
Do you understand?
Perfectly.
Good... and go talk to Piaggi! He's the one who probably knows the most about this.
AAAHHHHHHH !!!!!
Louis! Oh my God, no! Louis, hang on!!!
AAAHHHHHHH !!!!!
No, no, NO! Let me see, I have to stop the bleeding!
Louis, stay with me!...
Louis?...
Louis, no! LOUIS!!
Hang in there!! You'll be all right!! Come on!!
...my... my arm...
Nearly finished, come on... hold on!
...I can't... I can't feel my arm...
Stay with me, Louis! Come on!
Filthy swine!!... I'm going to open this damned door and skin you alive!!
You're not going to get the better of us!!
Mother...
Louis! You've come around! How do you feel?
I... It hurts, Mother... I... I... I can't feel my arm...
Louis, I had to cauterize it with what I could find.
Where's my arm?
We'll get through this, Louis, don't worry.
I think I've found a solution, you'll see...
No, we gotta leave... don't.. don't put your arm in there!
Louis, we can't leave without it. It's our last chance!
I need to see this through to the end... I must do it!
We've done it, Louis! Look!
Stubborn as a mule...
Come on, up you get, I'll help you. Easy does it, you've lost a lot of blood.
And now what?
Let's take what we came for!
I want to know how she managed to open it
Wait! I've got to know what I did wrong!
That is one fearsome mechanism.
In fact, if I hadn't watched you beforehand I would never have found the right combination.
Tell me... where did I go wrong?
First, the nails
The three nails. Yes, it's true... They let you open the iris...
Yes, but you still need to find the right theme, don't you? The fresco was a trap.
Apart from the fresco, everything pointed to the Crucifixion. The things that make it possible to activate the mechanism are associated with the crucifixion.
The cross to activate the mechanism and the nails to choose a date.
Then the iris
What did you do once you uncovered the iris?
I matched the icon of the crown of thorns with the town of Golgotha where the Crucifixion took place...
And the end?
... Well... How did you manage to crack the puzzle?
Then I had to link the crown of thorns to the date of the crucifixion, according to the Exegesis...
But I failed to understand the first time... With that theme in mind, I chose 26M which represents the 26th of March...
To conclude, I had to use the armillary sphere to find the moon corresponding to the day of the crucifixion, which turned out to be in the first quarter...
All that was left to do was to link all those elements on the same axis.
I know the first...
Damn, I was sure I had figured out how the lock worked...
Of course, Louis... But you still had to choose the right theme from the start.
It was the crucifixion... I matched its symbol, the crown of thorns, to the place where Christ was nailed to the cross, Golgotha.
I know the first and the second...
But... but I had linked the theme of the crucifixion to its date, its place and its symbol...
You know, I didn't do any better than you on the first go...
And it took two failures to get it right! You needed the middle disk of the lunar calendar, I think...
Let's get through the door
Come on!
Yes, my carelessness has cost me dearly....
Yes... But even so, we haven't time to feel sorry for ourselves, let's not waste another minute, LouisÂ !
Filthy swine!!... I'm going to open this damned door and skin you alive!!
You're not going to get the better of us!!
Mother...
Louis! You've come around! How do you feel?
I... It hurts, Mother... I... I... I can't feel my arm...
Louis, I had to cauterize it with what I could find.
Where's my arm?
We'll get through this, Louis, don't worry.
I think I've found a solution, you'll see...
No, we gotta leave... don't.. don't put your arm in there!
Louis, we can't leave without it. It's our last chance!
I need to see this through to the end... I must do it!
We've done it, Louis! Look!
Stubborn as a mule...
Come on, up you get, I'll help you. Easy does it, you've lost a lot of blood.
And now what?
Let's take what we came for!
