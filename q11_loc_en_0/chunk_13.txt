Flavius Aetius...
Inspect the sarcophagus
It was cut a long time ago, you can tell by the rough hacks of the tool and the patina of the stone...
This sarcophagus is very ancient, I'd say it's several centuries old...
The vanquisher of the Catalaunian Plains
I remember : he was the Roman general who defeated Attila and his hordes in the terrible battle of the Catalaunian Plains...
I was once taught something about this man...
Flavius Aetius, the one they call the last of the Romans...
He was assassinated by his own emperor, who was jealous of all his victories.
But how did he end up here?

This sarcophagus is engraved with the name of Clemens III.
Good God! The one whose cross allowed me to enter!
Translate
Clemens III... Clement III in French.
How come his tomb ended up here and not in the Vatican?
I know that name.
That was the pope from the Middle Ages who inspired the Third Crusade...
He gave the Roman people the power to elect their magistrates..
A powerful man who had an eventful reign.
He was basically an anti-pope...
His path to the throne was pretty turbulent, and he had to be enthroned several times!
The result of a long conflict between the papacy and the Holy Empire.

This sarcophagus is beautifully made, but ancient...
The stone is marked by the passage of time, but it's really well preserved.

The sarcophagus of Lord Mortimer...
Take a closer look
It's the only sarcophagus in this crypt which appears to bear the Mortimer family name...
What ancestor can it be? There's no inscription...
Inspect the sarcophagus
Let's see what we can find here.
Force open the lid
Ah, great! Now let's see what's inside....
Try to open it
It's far too heavy... I'm not gonna be able to do it on my own!
Inspect it in detail

The sarcophagus has been ravaged by time... It's sort of ageless, I guess...
It's entirely sculpted...
Decipher the inscriptions
These symbols, these grooves... cuneiform script.
This is Humanity's oldest alphabet, the language of Babel. Sadly, no one today even knows how to decipher it...
There's also some text engraved beneath in ancient Greek: Sargon.
Try to understand
Is this the tomb of a king? Judging by all the sculpted symbols of power...
This is really ancient, the... the inscriptions are all eroded...
I don't know what those marks mean... but maybe a prayer or an epitaph.

This one has no name, I wonder who it was for?

Saint Longinus...
Let's take a closer look at his lance...
Observe the lance
It is shaped like a leaf... like the real lance maybe?
How can I be sure?
Take a closer look
Hey... Looks like there's a symbol engraved on the tip...
Yes, a fish... The Christian fish no doubt... It can't be a coincidence, it must have been done on purpose...
Good thing I took a closer look!
