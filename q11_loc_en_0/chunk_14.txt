Mortimer is a deceiver...
No, this is too easy... Mortimer is trying to throw me off the track again!
It seems too visible to be true: impossible not to see the statue on first glance, given its size...
And Mortimer has no interest in making the shape of the true lance so easy to see!
What should I think?
I think the statue does represent Longinus, armed with the lance that wounded Jesus... The Holy Lance...
How can I find out if this is an exact representation? There's no way of being certain of it...

Saint Longinus...
Let's take a closer look at his lance...
Observe the lance
It is shaped like a leaf... like the real lance maybe?
How can I be sure?
Take a closer look
Hey... Looks like there's a symbol engraved on the tip...
Yes, a fish... The Christian fish no doubt... It can't be a coincidence, it must have been done on purpose...
Good thing I took a closer look!

Read the description
"Adoration of the Shepherds with Saints Longinus and John," Giulio Romano, 1534...
Examine the painting
Longinus is holding the Holy Lance in his left hand... and I'll bet he's holding the sponge soaked in holy blood in the other hand... Yes!
Here we can see that the Holy Lance is represented in the shape of a spear...
Distrust
I'd better make sure I check this twice, it's... it's a work that dates from the Renaissance...
There's nothing to say that it's not based on erroneous elements...
The letter mentioned this...
But I've read Mortimer's letter about this painting...
There's every reason to believe that this painting has been modified according to his guidelines, to represent the true shape of the Holy Lance...
A spear shape...
Recover the information
This work is an order from Lord Mortimer... All the details have been conceived with a specific goal in mind...
Upon closer examination, you can see that even the style clashes with that of most of the other works in the manor!
No, if Mortimer has taken special care as to the conception and exhibition of this painting in his study...
...in the same way as for the Nightmare painting, it must be of some significance.
And that is indeed the true shape of the Holy Lance, a spear shape!
Look for other information from elsewhere
There's only one way of being sure... I'll have to find other clues that will confirm this information.

Leave with this information
I have an idea of the shape of this lance now.

Examine
I can see this lance has...
A spear shape...
It is copper-rimmed...
And it has been engraved with the symbol of the Christian fish on the tip...
Take
There're several spearheads. I need to find clues to pick the right one... Piaggi knows something about it for sure.
I must be sure of my choice, I cannot get it wrong.
Am I absolutely sure this is the one to take?
Choose this lance
