Alright, alright! Calm down!
I don't give a damn about getting you in Sir Gregory's bad books!
Look at yourself, goddammit, you're ridiculous!
Shut it!
Don't think you're going to fool me so easily!
If you're not looking for the Lance for Sir Gregory, then why do you want it?
Make up for Piaggi's mistakes?
Mr von WÃ¶llner, would you be so kind as to calm yourself down, please!
All I'm trying to do is make amends for his Eminence's errors.
Sir Gregory should surround himself with better people, if you want my opinion, but Piaggi is a friend of my mother's.
What? I...
You want to help Piaggi?
I just told you, that's what my mother would do if she was here.
I heard you in the corridor and he seemed to be in serious trouble because of the Lances.
I'm only trying to help him.
Ah... alright, Louis.
For you, Wollner.
But calm yourself, goddammit! You're the one I'm trying to help.
What... what?
I heard you talking with his Eminence, and it seemed to me that this story about the Lances had put you in a tight spot.
I was only trying to be helpful.
But why didn't you tell me straight away?
Seeing as I hadn't found it, I... I didn't want to commit myself too quickly.
If I failed, I... I would have looked like a beginner.
I understand, Louis.
GOOD
I thought you were trying to manipulate me.
But please excuse me, I got a little bit carried away.
But you can't get ahead by staying in the shadows on a case like this.
There are already several of us searching for the Lance of Longinus, and it would be smarter to pool our information.
Unfortunately, I've barely made any progress. I'm still trying to find out what the original Lance really looked like.
Ach! Let me reassure you, we've all been there, given the number of copies there are in existence.
It also took us quite some time to discover it's true shape.
Many believe the central part of the head of the Lance to be covered in gold, whereas in truth, its center is made of an alloy of copper and iron.
That does make sense, in those times a centurion wouldn't have any chance of possessing a lance made of gold.
Ah! That is the perversion of Christian idolatry. A copper lance could not have been noble enough to pierce the side of Christ.
Anyway, thank you, sir.
You're welcome, Louis.
Keep me posted as to your research. We're bound to end up recovering it.
I'm counting on it.
See you later.
BAD
Drop it!
I can see very well you're trying to take me for a ride.
You have no idea of what you're getting yourself into, de Richet! Don't think you're going to get off lightly!
Never will I help you find the golden Lance of Longinus! Never!
Don't make me your competition, de Richet. You are no match.
Now, get out of here!
Examine
I can see that this lance has...
A so-called leaf shape...
It is clearly made of iron...
And I can make out a sun engraved on the tip...
Take
There're several spearheads. I need to find clues to pick the right one... Piaggi knows something about it for sure.
I must be sure of my choice, I can't get this wrong.
Am I sure this is the one to take?
Pick this lance
Move back

And I can just make out the symbol of the eye of Ra, engraved on the tip.
