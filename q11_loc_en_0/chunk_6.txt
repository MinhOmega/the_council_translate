Drop it!
I can see very well you're trying to take me for a ride.
You have no idea of what you're getting yourself into, de Richet! Don't think you're going to get off lightly!
Never will I help you find the golden Lance of Longinus! Never!
Don't make me your competition, de Richet. You are no match.
Now, get out of here!
De Richet?
Damn, that's all I need!
Maybe he knows something about the Lance...
What happened? You... You've lost... Ach, how horrible! Your hand!
I... It's an accident... To tell you the truth, I...
An accident? Are you joking? You have lost your hand, Louis!!!
We've got to do something!
It's been done! I've been given treatment, rest assured.
I admit that I didn't truly realize the consequences of my recklessness, so just stay calm...
Yes, yes... of course... but... Louis, it's your hand!
I know! Please!
There's nothing I can do about it. I know, I made a mistake, but it's too late now!
It was an accident. I only wanted to inspect the place to find my mother and, well, I fell into a trap...
The result is appalling, I... I grant you that but...
...at least I can guarantee that we're all perfectly safe here on this island!
And you joke about it?
Am I dreaming...?
No, sir, but let's be realistic...
So many world leaders brought together in one place and there are no safeguards? The error indeed stems from my recklessness.
I went looking here and there in search of my mother and I had an accident... It's my own fault.
Fine. We will drop this... incident? Why are you here?
What are you doing in my room?
Nothing
Don't take it the wrong way, I was just passing through...
Ach! Don't take me for a fool!
As far as I know, I did not invite you.
And I do not much appreciate you entering my quarters like this!
I was looking for you
Sir, perfect timing, I... I was looking for you...
You were looking for me?
Well, here I am. What can I do for you?
I was wondering if you might help me...
I have run out of things to read.
Von Wöllner... Let's not have a misunderstanding, I...
I had nothing else to read in my bookcase and I wondered if I...
Ach! Stop your blathering, de Richet!
The lances!
Well, sir, I see you have some captivating books and...
...you seem to be rather interested in the famous Longinus.
I... it's... what's it to do with you?
I overheard you speaking with Piaggi... What are you two up to exactly?
No, I... Fine! Yes, we are looking for the Holy Lance.
That imbecile has given Mortimer all the ones kept in the private collection of the Holy See!
But it... it's not what you think... I...
Hang on a minute...
Wait... that's my book!
You're the one looking for the Lance!
No, I...
Don't take me for a fool! You are looking for the Holy Lances!
Refer him to the Al Azif
Not at all, I...
I've come here to talk to you about the Al Azif.
Ach, you are lying through your teeth!
You are not here for the Al Azif!
No, of course not.
Wh... What makes you think that?
You are a very bad liar, my lad!
Don't think you're going to get away with it so easily!
Pretend not to
Why, of course not.
What makes you think that?
You are a bad liar, my boy!
Don't think you are going to get away with it so easily!
What are you so afraid of?
What's the matter?
You seem completely panicked at the idea I might be interested in this relic.
I... no! No! That's not true!
What are you so afraid of?
I'm not afraid!
You know Mortimer's got it, so you're not worried that I'd give it back to him.
What are you...?
So why are you so terrified of me being able to find it?
You have no idea what it is you're looking for...
I'm only looking for the right one.
I'm not looking for the Lances of Longinus, von Wöllner.
I'm looking for THE Lance of Longinus. The one that pierced Christ's side.
You are playing with fire!
Don't take it the wrong way, I'll leave you all the copies.
Don't worry about that!
Good answer...
What are you playing at, de Richet?
Mortimer's the one who has that cursed Lance.
How long have you been looking for it?
Ah, I see! You want it, and so you planned to steal it from Mortimer...
For a long time, isn't that right?
Why you little swine! You're planning to give it to Sir Gregory!
You're looking to double-cross me, and Piaggi too!
What on earth is he talking about?
Yes, I want to give it to Holm.
That's right! You can read me like an open book!
I'll find the Lance before you and make you look like a fool in front of Holm!
Hang on... you're trying to pull one over on me... if that was your plan, you wouldn't reveal it so easily!
It must be for something else...
No, you jackass!
