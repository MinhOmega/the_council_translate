The exegesis is extremely detailed, with a lot of information about the life of Jesus.
I'm bound to find something about the Holy Lance!
Let's see if I'm right...
Flip through
This book is much too dense, I need to be more specific...
What elements of the death of Jesus could I use?
The last supper
No, there can't be anything to do with the lance there...
It's much too early...
The trial
There's no mention of the lance during the trial of Jesus.
The resurrection
Not quite specific enough but we're almost there: "the Lord was pierced on his right side by the lance of a centurion..."
Golgotha
Look, it's mentioned here! Of course, the place of the crucifixion!
"The ordeal of Christ ends when Longinus pierces his right side with his shimmering lance"...
A shimmering lance...
It must be made with copper because Longinus was a simple centurion. It'd be inconsistent if it were a noble metal...
What metal shines like that?
Longinus was a simple centurion so it must be decorated with copper. It'd be inconsistent if it were a noble metal...

The betrayal of Judas
"Against his will and with his face bathed in tears, Judas Iscariot accepted the ultimate and terrible mission claimed by the Lord..."
No, this passage has nothing to do with the lance...

Those books must mean the lance which finally took the life of Christ...
Search in the gospels.
The 4 gospels each give an account of the death of Christ. Let's see what they can tell me about the lance...
According to Mathew
There's nothing about the lance in this account of the crucifixion...
According to Mark
This apostle does not mention the lance in his description of the death of Christ..
According to Luke
There's no mention of the lance in what Luke says about the death of Christ...
According to John
Ah there! In John's exegesis...
"When they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs;
But one of the soldiers with a shimmering lance pierced his side, and forthwith there came out blood and water.
And he that saw it bore witness, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe."
"A shimmering lance"... What is this telling me?
Find a clue of what the lance looks like
The medieval hermetic traditions evoked the idea of using noble materials for relics...
Which the monasteries often made themselves, in order to attract pilgrims...
Of course they had to inspire greatness... So here we might think of gold whereas a centurion could not have hoped for anything better than copper at the time!
The true lance would not have been a luxurious weapon...
Know who it is
The name of the Roman soldier who killed Christ never appears in the biblical canon...
Yet, it is said that he was a centurion and was called Longinus...

And he that saw it bore witness, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe."
