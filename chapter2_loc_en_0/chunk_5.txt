a ship bound for Marseilles, in France, has been chartered.
Hidden aboard are a few corpses infected with the plague that is decimating our country at this moment in time.
Be very careful when handling these boxes because if inadvertently opened,
you risk spreading the disease all over France.

My dear friend,
With thanks for your services rendered and help in the fight against the Spanish and the conquest of Oran,
a ship bound for Marseilles, in France, has been chartered.
Hidden aboard are a few corpses infected with the plague that is decimating our country at this moment in time.
Be very careful when handling these boxes because if inadvertently opened,
you risk spreading the disease all over France.

My Lord,
I hope this letter will reach you. My hours are numbered.
My printing house has been confiscated and I am imprisoned in the fortress of Shlisselburg.
If by chance, you could intervene in my favor, I would be eternally in your debt.
The Czarina Catherine should not be long in banning all Golden Order lodges from her territory.
Our horizon has become considerably darker... 
In the hope that you can help me, your friend,
Nikolay Novikov

My dearest Lord Mortimer,
As a friend of China, rest assured that you will be rewarded for your information.
You need not worry about any scheming against us from Great Britain. Their representative, Mr Macartney, will leave with no hope of any arrangements involving us.
Your friend,
Qianlong, Emperor of the Qing dynasty.

Lord Mortimer,
The tiger is dying. On your demand I have attacked Travancore and personally cut the throats of as many Englishmen as possible though without help from the French,
I cannot hold them off much longer.
My forces are rapidly diminishing in spite of your new rockets.
Help us.
