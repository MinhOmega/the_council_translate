Dear Lord Mortimer,
Be assured of my entire devotion.
As agreed, the Vendée peasantry will soon rise up.
My network is striving to increase the pressure on the masses.
The decision of the Assembly which consists of voting the civil constitution of the clergy is inflaming the region.
The people overwhelmingly reject the priests, and swear loyalty to the State.
If you could ensure that the Convention will administer the final blow to the people, the issue will be resolved.
Without wishing to direct you, a forced recruitment for a faraway conflict would be a perfect way to arouse the people definitively.
Your devoted servant,
François Athanase Charrette de la Contrie
Sir,
Your plans to intervene in Belgium are to go ahead as set down.
I am to occupy the Prussian army.
Your delivery of cannons to Valmy has ensured our victory.
As agreed, I have notified the King of Prussia of the invasion plans of Custine and the Army of the North,
I will keep the Austrians out of Belgium.
I am to quickly return to Paris as I sense the fate of our King Louis is about to be decided dishonorably and it is impossible for me not to intervene.
Should you have any missives to give to me, I invite you to go by, as per usual, our friend, Monsieur Péru.
Sincerely yours,
Charles-François Dumouriez, General of the Army of the North.

My dear friend,
Thank you for your words and I do understand your situation.
I regret having to confront you militarily,
but if the situation obliges me to declare war, then do what you think fit.
Under your advisement and with a weary heart, I am off to meet up with the coalition that opposes you.
In the hope of serving you again.
George, King of Hanover, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

My dearest Lord Mortimer,
I regret to inform you that it will soon be impossible to ignore pressure from the Russians.
The Czarina Catherine has every intention of supporting the Count of Provence and will recognize him as the regent of the Kingdom of France,
once King Louis has disappeared from the political stage.
I am sorry to announce bad news but expect dark times ahead.
Your friend,
Elfriede Bauer

William,
Whatever your projects, it would seem that our father is against leaving you with a grip on Europe.
Russia will soon commit itself to the coalition against your dear France.
Don't think you can resist for long.
I beseech you, William, not to persist, you are tearing our family apart.
You loving brother.
G.
P.S. I shall come to your conference but do you think that holding it at the present moment is conductive?

My dearest friend,
Our plans are going ahead wonderfully well. The Coinage Act has been voted,
your project of founding the very first bank of America should not be delayed and will probably be called Union Bank.
As for the construction of the White House, it is still die to begin in October.
I will accept no delays, you can trust me on this.
I hope to see you soon.

The gift has been delivered.
Timur Shah Durrani, King of Afghanistan, of Punjab, of Sindh, of Mashhad and of Kashmir should not retain his title much longer.
His son, Zaman, will succeed him as planned. We will then be able to resume negotiations
