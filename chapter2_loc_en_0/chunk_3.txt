My dear friend,
I am writing because my cover appears to be blown. Our mutual friend asks you above all not to come, and to prepare our escape as a matter of urgency.
We must be gone before the next guests arrive.
See you soon.
Yours, E.

My dear friend,
The latest news from our Corsican friends is not very reassuring.
Would you be so kind as to go there promptly in order to remind our friend Paoli of our respective arrangements?
The Sardinian expedition must be a fiasco for the French army and I am anxious about young lieutenant Bonaparte's determination to shine more than necessary.
I shall leave you to take care of it.
Kind regards,
Sir Gregory Holm.

Dear Lord Mortimer,
I am writing to ask you to persuade President Washington not to sign the Fugitive Slave Act, as it stands.
We must absolutely legislate on a national level and not allow every State to choose their policy regarding slaves.
It was initially intended to resolve a conflict between Pennsylvania and Virginia, by signing it we risk legislating the hunting of blacks.
More and more men of little faith are becoming slave hunters. And, unable to find any slaves on the run, they kidnap the first black they come across which they pass off as the wanted runaway.
The situation threatens to quickly degenerate.
Thank you in advance.
Your friend,
John Adams
P.S. Say hello to my daughter, Elizabeth, for me.

Dear Lord Mortimer,
I regret to inform you that our plans in Poland are set to fail.
Russia and Prussia are working in cohort to bleed our dear Poland.
We have no power here.
We continue to maintain pressure as best we can on the Prussian border as agreed in order to occupy Frederick William's army, but I do not know how long we can keep it up.
Your devoted servant,

Dear Lord Mortimer,
Be assured of my entire devotion.
As agreed, the Vendée peasantry will soon rise up.
My network is striving to increase the pressure on the masses.
The decision of the Assembly which consists of voting the civil constitution of the clergy is inflaming the region.
The people overwhelmingly reject the priests, and swear loyalty to the State.
If you could ensure that the Convention will administer the final blow to the people, the issue will be resolved.
Without wishing to direct you, a forced recruitment for a faraway conflict would be a perfect way to arouse the people definitively.
