Leave the Order. Flee Paris and its private salons. If you want to be happy, if you want to have a chance to live, give up everything at once and disappear!
I would love for you to be by my side. I have so much to tell you that I haven't said before.
I apologize for your harsh upbringing.
I was determined that you would be able to continue my fight. I had planned a great future for you.
But it is all a farce. I was mistaken. I was playing a game without knowing all the rules, and I lost.
But I want you to know that I did everything I could to save you. I'm so angry with myself.
Live, Louis, just live!
And whatever happens, stay as you are.
Your loving mother.
My dear Louis,
I am writing in the knowledge that you will never be able to read my letter, but I must write it.

George Washington, that good old George holds Mortimer in high esteem. (He probaby owes him something)
Johann von Wöllner, if we serve his interests, would provide important support. (Warning, very interested in the Occult)
Cardinal Piaggi. Good reputation. Warning, too close to Chiaramonti! Risk of being influenced!
Jacques Péru. A  power in Paris. Devoted to the Republic. Unstable and dangerous!
Napoleon Bonaparte. Unknown. Minor lieutenant in the army. Corsican. Careerist.
