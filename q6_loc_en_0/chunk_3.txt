Or even the capture of Jerusalem, where approximately 30,000 were left dead.
It signaled the beginning of centuries of wars of religion.
Second crusade (5147-5149)
Or how Louis VII, King of France, eager to be pardoned for the death of thousands of innocent people in the fire of the church of Vitry...
... convinces the pope to authorize him to lead his own crusade...
The result: in Germany, a new outburst of violence against the Jewish community.
And a monumental fiasco by poor Louis VII, cuckolded by his wife's uncle.
Third crusade (5189-5192)
The famous call from Pope Gregory VIII in his Audita Tremendi bull of 5187... ?
Oh, the crusade where Richard the Lionheart had distinguished himself.
It states that the first sea blockade of Saint Jean d'Acre was broken in the 12th month of 5190 AL, whereas the siege had been going on for two years.
Link the author to the dates
The author is Pierre Amédée de la Sarde...
None other than the grand master of the Masonic Lodge of Paris.
Now I understand why the dates are offset.
He's using dates based on Anno Lucis, year zero of the masonic calendar, by adding 4000 years to the Gregorian calendar.
But, I thought that that calendar starts in March...
Analyze the dates
The crusades took place not long after the year one thousand.
Here all the dates say 5000 and something...  I'm guessing this dating system begins 4000 years before the calendar that we use.
Yet I'm getting the feeling that there's something else, another small detail but...  but what is it?
Put it down
Notice something
It's a complex mechanism... 
Hmm...  Looks like the third ring is a bit seized up: it gets stuck on number 9.
Lower the lever.
Watch the rollers
Looks like there's a marker on number 1 on the second roller... 
Move away

...  dammit, it doesn't work.
5190...  I was pretty sure it was right. Maybe I didn't use the right dating system?
...  dammit, it doesn't work.
5190...  I was pretty sure it was right. Maybe I didn't use the right dating system?
... it doesn't work, dammit.
I really thought I was close? 1190...  isn't that the right date when you subtract 4000? I must have missed a subtlety.

... still not working.
I get the impression I counted the wrong way. It must be one year more, then, right?

Well...  I got it wrong. It doesn't matter.

This looks like the same mechanism as the one on the other side... 
Examine the lever.
Looks like the same as the one on the other side.
Think about the lock.
It looks too easy...  It could be a trap.
Think about the mechanism as a whole.
The mechanism passes through the wall, the wheels are the same on both sides.
Chances are, the combination I used on the other side works on this side too.
Think about the shape of the cylinders.
These cylinders rotate on the same central axis. So when I enter a number on one side, it corresponds to another one on the other side.
Lower the lever.

Yet I'm sure there's a connection with the date that I've entered earlier to open the door.
Maybe I'm not approaching the problem from the right angle.

I thought about the inversion of the numbers, that's not it...  what am I missing here?

These cylinders are driving me crazy. Have I got something wrong with my positioning?

Woahh! If the grid closes a bit more every time I enter a wrong date, I'd...  I'd better not mess up again.

Emily, I must speak to you...
What's the matter, Louis?
About...  last night, I'm guessing?
I...  sadly, no, even if I'd have liked to, I...
Alas, there are more pressing matters...
I have news about your sister.
What have you found out?
Look. I've started piecing together the events leading up to my mother's disappearance...  and your sister's.
Did...  did my mother know about your secret?
Yes, even though I belong to the English chapter, her rank in the Order gives her access to a good deal of personal information.
