It might be a place. I don't know where but it's a lead.
You ought to ask his Eminence; he knows the house and its estate very well, being a frequent visitor here.
Thanks for the advice.
Figuratively, no doubt a metaphor
My mother used to talk about it. In the figurative sense, probably.
We still need to understand what she was referring to, though.
If I find something, I'll let you know.
Don't send her on my mother's trail.
If Mother's really killed her sister, I'd better find her by myself.
They say they spent a lot of time together.
They got along well.
Oh, really?
Do you think your mother liked Duchess Hillsborrow?
Of course, she did. After all, she's your sister.
Well, We'll find them, Emily. Trust me.
Let's go, Louis, they're waiting for us.
Should I speak to her about my vision? If what I saw is true, she might want to take revenge...
Tell her
Emily...  There's something else...
Go on then.
It's...  It's about your sister.
I don't know what happened exactly, but it's possible that my mother had a go at her.
I know, Louis. I found out that same evening.
Well, thanks for not trying to hide it.
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know if I could trust you.
Now I know I can.
It seems that your mother tricked Emma. She apparently asked her to hide an important book, so that even she wouldn't know where it was.
And then she shot her like a dog to make sure no one would ever find it again.
Does she know why?
Why would she do that?
I don't know Louis.
But I'll find out, you can count on that!
Who spoke to her about it?
How did you find out?
Sir Gregory told me on my arrival.
Keep quiet
I'd better keep that to myself for the time being...
I'm sincerely sorry, Emily.
Thank you, Louis.
You're very kind, it means a lot to me.
But you do realize your mother will have to accept the consequences of her acts.
But, there must be an explanation, Emily...
That's what we shall see.
We'll speak about it later somewhere...  safe.
Come Louis, they're waiting for us.
A table of alchemical elements.
So, Lord Mortimer also studies alchemy. It seems like he's interested in everything...

The wheels are stuck! Shit! I'm cornered like a rat!
Someone's coming... 
Please, don't let it be Mortimer!
Of course! How could I even imagine he would be here!
Who is it?
Deliberately avoiding me! Four years ago I was his favorite but nowadays I have to ask for an audience with his lordship... 
Dammit! It's Péru... 
Keep quiet
I don't know if I should but... 
Well, that's it! I've had enough of being humiliated!!
I'm wasting my time here... 
Call for help
Monsieur Péru!
It's Monsieur de Richet. I'm sort of trapped behind this painting.
Help me out of here, please!
What are you playing at, goddammit!
How can I open it?
After everything I've done on his behalf, he dares treat me like a lackey!
Keep quiet
I've bled the Parisian elite for the sake of his whims and what have I got to show for it?
Doesn't even have the courtesy to give me five minutes of his time!
I wanted to put my mind at ease...  Well that's done. I know what I've got to to do now.
I must find my mother!  So much for discretion..
Monsieur Péru?
It's me, Monsieur de Richet. I need your help... 
What the devil is going on... ?
Where are you, de Richet?
Behind the painting. Open it, please, I've shut myself in.
Call for help
Monsieur Péru!
It's Monsieur de Richet. I've locked myself in behind the painting.
Help me get out, please!
What are you playing at, goddammit!
There's a pedal under Lord Mortimer's desk.
Can you see it?
There's no...  hang on, yes... 
Good, now press it.
Yeah, yeah...  Done.
You should see something resembling a frame with numbers... 
Yes...  You have to turn them to set the combination.

It's not working.
You sure about this?
