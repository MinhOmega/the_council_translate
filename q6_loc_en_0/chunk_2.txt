They say it's her guilty little morning ritual, before getting dressed. A cup with one sugar and some vanilla, if I remember rightly.
I wouldn't be surprised if Mortimer has them delivered straight from South America.

Chocolates. It's said they cause nightmares, but I doubt that's what my mother was trying to say.
No hidden mechanisms here. I'll have to look elsewhere.
Let's take a closer look... 
Take a chocolate
Dark chocolate beans. Very bitter.
They're greatly prized in high society.
Examine the chocolates
Judging by the shape, I'd say they're Criollo coco beans. The chocolate of the Mayas, the rarest of the beans.
Some even say they're an aphrodisiac... 
When a product is in fashion, people attribute all sorts of virtues to it... 
Not to be given to animals.
The dessert the most in vogue nowadays!
These chocolates are probably a protocol gift. Everybody in Europe loves them nowadays.
Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, has her own personal chocolate maker at Versailles.

Move away
Some goat skulls...  Chicken legs...  Now we all know what that's for.
I'm a little surprised at Mortimer.
I didn't see him as the type to be organizing little pagan parties, invoking occult powers, and dancing naked under the full moon.
I'm more used to seeing cheap charms like this sold by charlatans in Pré Saint Gervais.

Hey! A book on Fuseli... 
In 1783,  one of his paintings was a huge success.
Translate the preface
“William,
I hope you'll find a place worthy of the name for my Nightmare.
I look forward to seeing it hanging in your abode.
Your friend, Henry Fuseli “
Read the description
“It represents a woman lying down, with the devil sitting on her. In the background, a horse is looking at the scene through curtains... ”
It's most common title is...  “The Nightmare”
Why, yes... that rings a bell... 
I swear I've seen that painting somewhere around here...  But where?

It's a book on the history of the crusades. I don't think it has any connection with my research.
I don't think this book can help me.
History of the First Crusades by Pierre Amedée de la Sarde.
Strange...  all the dates are all...  wrong; they indicate events that took place in the year 5000 and something.
Wait, did I miss something?
Hey, the dates indicate “AL”, and it looks like 4000 years have been added to our calendar...  oh that counting system again!
First crusade (5096-5099)
The famous call of Pope Urban II.
Twenty years after the capture of Jerusalem from the Arabs by the Turks, Urban II convened the council.
He promises a Plenary Indulgence to Christians who go and get Jerusalem back from the Turks.
The result: the Jewish community on the road to Jerusalem found itself persecuted for no reason. Twelve thousand Jews would perish.
Not to mention the massacre of Ma'arra, where acts of cannibalism by Frankish crusaders were reported.
Or even the capture of Jerusalem, where approximately 30,000 were left dead.
It signaled the beginning of centuries of wars of religion.
Second crusade (5147-5149)
Or how Louis VII, King of France, eager to be pardoned for the death of thousands of innocent people in the fire of the church of Vitry...
... convinces the pope to authorize him to lead his own crusade...
The result: in Germany, a new outburst of violence against the Jewish community.
And a monumental fiasco by poor Louis VII, cuckolded by his wife's uncle.
Third crusade (5189-5192)
The famous call from Pope Gregory VIII in his Audita Tremendi bull of 5187... ?
Oh, the crusade where Richard the Lionheart had distinguished himself.
It states that the first sea blockade of Saint Jean d'Acre was broken in the 12th month of 5190 AL, whereas the siege had been going on for two years.
Link the author to the dates
The author is Pierre Amédée de la Sarde...
None other than the grand master of the Masonic Lodge of Paris.
Now I understand why the dates are offset.
He's using dates based on Anno Lucis, year zero of the masonic calendar, by adding 4000 years to the Gregorian calendar.
But, I thought that that calendar starts in March...
Analyze the dates
The crusades took place not long after the year one thousand.
Here all the dates say 5000 and something...  I'm guessing this dating system begins 4000 years before the calendar that we use.
Yet I'm getting the feeling that there's something else, another small detail but...  but what is it?
Put it down
