I'm not interested.
I doubt that Lord Mortimer invited him for his charm, if you want my opinion.
Leave her.
You're leaving me?
Unfortunately, I have things to do. Thank you again, Madam.
Tell me more about the coming conference.
Emily, what can you tell me about the coming conference?
Sir Gregory and Lord Mortimer organize this kind of high society meeting every so often in order to consider the world situation.
But to what purpose?
Well, by bringing together the most influential people from the dominant nations of the modern world, they allow the mighty to discuss matters with calm clarity.
There are precedents of armistices being signed at the end of these talks, you know...
Talking while holding a glass of brandy makes things easier, you'll see.
Monsieur Bonaparte, may I speak with you a moment?
Mais oui.
Tell me more about the coming conference.
Would you have any more information about the conference Lord Mortimer spoke of?
Nothing at all.
Mortimer is very committed to secrecy when it comes to his conferences.
But given the presence of Monsieur Péru and ourselves, I think it must concern France to some extent, otherwise I doubt he would have invited three Frenchmen to his table.
Ask him about “the nightmare”.
Does the expression "go beyond the nightmare" mean anything to you at all?
Well, metaphorically, yes, it sums up the career of a soldier quite well.
I doubt that is what you want to hear, though.
Indeed.
That's surely not what I'm looking for... 
Well, monsieur, if you are looking for a phrase book, Lord Mortimer must surely have one, giving the number of books he has.
You ought to check in the library of the Tower, you never know.
Ask him his opinion of Godoy.
What do you think of Duke Godoy?
Well, I'd rather not express any opinion of him.
Why is that?
His reputation is enough for me!
His reputation precedes him.
There are some rumors about his loose morals... 
Juste, monsieur. Add to that his devouring ambition, if you want my opinion... 
Playing at lover-boy rather than gaining merit for his career, it's a disgrace for any soldier!
Tell me more... 
Meaning?
This gentleman enjoys people talking about him for too many reasons... 
His undeserved titles...  More than ten in just four years! And each one more prestigious than the one before.
You don't think he deserves them?
If I had seen him on the battlefield, there might be some doubt... 
But that is not the case.
The Queen would rather not risk losing him, so she consoles him with awards and titles!
So you don't have a very positive opinion... 
His coveting French Catalonia does not encourage me to have one... 
He doesn't give a damn about his reputation.
I'm sure that a soldier such as yourself is not interested in vulgar rumors.
Quite right.
If only this cursed gossip didn't come to stain the uniform he has the audacity to wear.
Don't you find him worthy?
But how could he be, monsieur? He never sets foot on the battlefield, too occupied with charming the Queen!
Have you any idea of the number of titles that coward has won in just a few years?
No, not really.
Ten! And that Don Juan spends the best part of his time under the Queen's skirts.
The bugger must have some hidden talent given all of the gifts she gives him!
Will this not be an opportunity to get to know him better?
You'll be able to check if the hearsay is true over these next few days... 
I sincerely doubt that... 
The context does not allow me to give him my trust!
I understand your point of view.
Leave Napoleon
Well, I'll be leaving you now.
Shall we meet up again later?
Wait, monsieur.
Any news of your mother?
Unfortunately not, no.
I hope to speak with her about my deal before I leave.
Let me know if you find her.
A plus tard, monsieur.

Mais oui.
