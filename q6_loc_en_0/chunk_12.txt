Gentlemen, this news affects us all but I must ask you to remain calm.
It's not the first time History has taken us by surprise.
Let's ensure that our respective countries are allowed to respond appropriately to this news.
Oh, rest assured, the response will not fall short, my friend.
Good for you.
Well, your Grace, here I was preparing to introduce you as is proper, and you've beaten me to it.
I'm delighted that we are all together at last. Our meeting will therefore be able to kick off shortly.
I have just a few more little preparations to take care of before you all find out the reason for your presence here.
In the meantime, I shall leave you to get to know one another.
When you hear the bell, please proceed to the conclave room on my left, behind that door.
I'll see you later.
Am I seeing things, or is that an actual Van Leeuwenhoek microscope?
Incredible! Mortimer really is at the cutting edge of science.
Even at the Order, it took us ages to get one of those.

Dear Mr Guido Poletti,
I'm writing with regard to the dates of the paintings that I sent you for your temporary exhibition.
Please note that they are part of my private collection and are dated according to the Freemason's calendar (AL) in use at the time.
As you may well have guessed, you must remember to subtract four thousand years if you don't want the public to be surprised at the dating of the works.
No need to remind you that the Freemason year (AL) begins in March, not january.
About the Longinus painting, I took the liberty to have the spear touched up so it better corresponds to the actual spear.
I cannot urge you strongly enough to do the same for yours.
Yours sincerely.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer, Marquis of Westfordshire.

This painting isn't finished... 
And looks like Mortimer probably did it... 
Not bad but you can't exactly say it's been done in the style of the period.

"The Nightmare" painted by Fuseli in 1781.
Ah...  This must be what my mother was talking about!
Now, just need to find out what she meant by "go beyond".
Hey...  looks like it's mounted on rails on each side. It should lift up, I think.
There must be a mechanism somewhere...

Aha! I found it!... 
Woah...  what on earth is this?
A ring lock now? Great. That's all I needed...

Open sesame.
Open sesame.
Now, now what have we got here?
Looks like a model...  A model of a lock. It's as if Mortimer is fond of complicating things sometimes.
Well, I hope I never have to try and unlock it.

Looks like a war painting, it's dated.
Ok, no mechanism behind this painting. I'll have to keep looking
Hey...  there are two dates on this painting!
1154 A.D. and 5154 A.L.
Analyze the dates
The two dates most likely relate to two calendars: the Gregorian calendar and the Freemason calendar.

A painting about a siege, dated.
No mechanism here.
A painting depicting the third crusade. It's titled “The Winter before the Fall of Saint Jean d'Acre”
Analyze the scene.
From what I know, the fall of Saint Jean d'Acre took place in the summer of 1191.
Now according to this title, it's wintertime on the painting, so it can't have been late in the year of 1191.
It must be in the first months of that year. Probably in January or February of that year.
Situate the scene.
The siege of Saint Jean d'Acre...  It was a major conflict during the third crusade.
Richard the Lionheart and Philip Augustus fought to take the town back.
It was the crusaders'  first operation to take back the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
Link to readings
I get the impression I've seen that before.
In fact, I've read something on the Crusades before in this study.
He clearly loves the subject.
