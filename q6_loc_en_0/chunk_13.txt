A painting about a siege, dated.
No mechanism here.
A painting depicting the third crusade. It's titled “The Winter before the Fall of Saint Jean d'Acre”
Analyze the scene.
From what I know, the fall of Saint Jean d'Acre took place in the summer of 1191.
Now according to this title, it's wintertime on the painting, so it can't have been late in the year of 1191.
It must be in the first months of that year. Probably in January or February of that year.
Situate the scene.
The siege of Saint Jean d'Acre...  It was a major conflict during the third crusade.
Richard the Lionheart and Philip Augustus fought to take the town back.
It was the crusaders'  first operation to take back the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

I get the impression I've seen that before.
In fact, I've read something on the Crusades before in this study.
He clearly loves the subject.

William Alexander Mortimer 1st, the 12th month of Anno Lucis 5190.
That's a funny date... 
Analyze
The date's calculated in Anno Lucis. The twelfth month is...  February?
So that makes...  that makes it February...  1191.
That funny date again... 
That date in 5000 and something again... 
I wonder what in the world it means...

“Le coup de Lance" by Paul Rubens.
No, let's look elsewhere.

Analyze the painting.
It's Christ on the Cross, as Longinus pierces his side with his spear.
Rubens. He was a great painter.

"Weakness of the Human Psyche" by Guilhem Trimmoer.
Mh, he says: "It is possible to drill an idea into someone by constant daily repetition, until the mind gives in".
And goes on: "There are hundreds of good ways to live life, but you only need one to convince the masses that it's the only one possible".
The author isn't letting any ethical principals get in his way, is he ?

You are expected in the small salon, Sir.
A skeleton...  by the name of Gustave, if the plaque on the plinth is anything to go by.
Mortimer has given a name to his anatomy skeleton...  that's morbid.
Ah, his right hand is missing.

What do you want, Louis?
Ask her about the nightmare.
I have a question that might seem a bit strange, but...
Go on.
If I said "Go beyond the nightmare", would that mean anything to you?
Mmmm...  No, means nothing to me...
Do you mean literally or figuratively speaking?
Literally, why not a place.
It can be a place. I don't know where but it...  it's a lead I think.
You ought to ask his Eminence; he knows the house and its estate very well, being a frequent visitor.
I believe he's in the Grand Salon...
Thank you for your advice.
In the figurative sense, no doubt a metaphor
In the figurative sense, probably.
I'm trying to understand what it refers to.
Well, if I come up with anything, I'll let you know.
Speak about the nightmare again.
I've already asked you but I don't remember the answer.
What did you say to me about "going beyond the nightmare"?
Good heavens, you're losing your memory!
I haven't the least idea what it might mean.
Oh, alright. That's too bad.
Ask her opinion about Godoy.
What do you think of our last guest?
Well, I never thought I would get the chance to meet that Hispanic Casanova in the flesh.
His reputation is well known. The gentleman collects lovers, including would you believe it, the Queen of Spain...  !
Mention the rumor
The Queen of Spain likes to indiscreetly say: "the King, Godoy and myself make up the Holy Trinity"!
The people have appropriatly renamed them "the goat, the ruffian and the whore"!
(laughing) I didn't see you being a mudslinger in your idle hours, I must say!
