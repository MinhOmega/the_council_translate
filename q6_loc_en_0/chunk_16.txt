The blue eyes of the latest infanta, Maria Isabel, have left everyone wondering...
Rumors always accompany men of power, your Eminence...
Naturally, but the number of awards and titles granted by the Queen during these past four years leaves little doubt!
So, Godoy really is this out-and-out rascal who uses his charms on the Queen.
Don't take note
Leave him
Thank you for everything, your Eminence.
I shan't take up anymore of your time.
You are welcome, my son.
I will be seeing you, Louis.
Ah, Louis, just the man.
Good Lord, how did the King come to be executed?
I would think that the Order would have intervened!
The King was playing with fire.
Your Eminence, I haven't been following the case. I'm sure that the Order did everything in its power.
Unfortunately, you know the situation in Paris and...
Well, it's chaotic at best. Anything can happen in those revolutionary tribunals.
The king is the official representative of God on earth, my son!
Your Eminence, France has become a secular state.
The King was just another citizen to them. He refused to admit his errors, looked down upon them and attempted to escape.
What did he expect?
France has lost all reason, Louis...
The King made things worse all by himself.
Your Eminence, I'm sorry for King Louis but he did everything to put himself there.
Louis! How can you say such a thing?
Even if France rejects the Church, you don't go and behead a person of high status! They always serve our cause better alive than dead.
Politically, it's absurd!
Don't insist
I invite you to speak about it with my mother as soon as she reappears.
Is there Any news of her?
I...  Well, I hope it won't be long before I find her, your Eminence.
Louis, I'm counting on you!
If you don't find Sarah before my departure, I must ask you to give me back the letter I gave you.
Well, don't worry about that, your Eminence.
Now, you wanted to speak to me?
Do you know the theme of the conference?
I'm sure a man like you is in the circle of trust. Would you know what the conference that Lord Mortimer mentioned is going to be about?
Not really, my son.
Well, be it Lord Mortimer or Sir Gregory, we are never informed about the theme of the conference before it begins.
Ask him about “the nightmare”.
If I say "the nightmare" to you, does it make you think of anything?
Your question is strange, my son...
Difficult to say. Could you at least tell me a little more about the context?
A place or an object?
Well, I mean, if it were a place or an object found on this island, what would you think of first?
Mmm, the nightmare...  Mmmmm...
No, I don't see anything...  I'm sorry.
Well, that's too bad.
Ah...  wait...  I suppose it might be that horrible painting hanging in Lord Mortimer's study.
Make him believe you're not that interested.
Right...  Well, don't worry about it, I was...  I was just curious.
A connection with anything here
Think of a place and tell me the first thing that comes into your mind when I say "the nightmare".
Mmm, let me think.
I'd say...
Lord Mortimer's favorite painting, on the wall behind his desk.
You know, that painting caused quite a stir when it was exhibited.
It is titled the nightmare and it shows a woman lying down with a creature sitting on her, and in the background, a horse.
I don't know if it will be of any help, but I can't think of anything else.
You never know...  Thank you for that though, your Eminence.
I ought to go and see it, just in case, though.
Ask him his opinion of Godoy.
I was wondering what to think of that Manuel Godoy.
He is reputed to be a very ambitious character...  at every level.
But his faith is unwavering. He is a staunch defender of the Church. You can believe me.
I know of his reputation.
It's true there's much said about him...
For better and for worse but that is a prerogative of power, it would seem.
His close ties with the Queen unfortunately sully her government.
Fortunately, we are not men to take heed of such gossip.
Are we?
Of course not, your Eminence.
What a disgrace nonetheless for the King.
I can only imagine...
If I were to officiate at the Court of Spain, believe me, I would speak out!
She is of Bourbon lineage, by God's grace, she has a duty toward her blood!
What can we expect, your Eminence, everything gets lost over the years.
Tell me about these rumors?
As to his faith, I have no doubt.
However, his ambition seems to surpass his morality.
And I hope that it will not sully the crown.
You can say that again...

Speak about the “nightmare”.
“Go beyond the nightmare”... 
Does this line remind you of anything in particular?
You've caught me unaware here, Louis.
Let me think about it a second..
No, nothing comes to mind.
Sorry, Louis, but I am unable to help you.
Ask him his opinion of Godoy.
