I've wasted enough time, I'd better get moving if I want to find my mother!

A myna bird.
Waldo...   pretty boy Waldo...  pretty boy
Feed the bird
Give chocolate
Give red berries
Back
Speak to the bird
Lord Mortimer
Well, Waldo, is your master good?
Pretty boy Waldo...  pretty boy...
I don't really know what I was expecting...
Ask him for the code, you never know.
Tell me the door code.
Pretty boy Waldo...  pretty boy...
Here I am, talking to a bird...  shame on me...
Sarah de Richet
Sarah de Richet, Waldo, you know Sarah?
Sarah...  Sarah, don't go...  Stop it...  Stop it, no...
What? Repeat that Waldo, Sarah, what about Sarah!
Don't go...  Sarah, no...  No, stop, Sarah...  Stop it.. No...
Good God, what's been happening here?
Back
Move away
All right, that's enough of that.
If I go on talking to a myna bird, I'll...  I'll end up going crazy...
Move away
Waldo...  pretty boy...
Pretty boy Waldo...  damned rollers...  pretty boy...
Waldo...  symetric...  pretty boy...   I keep forgetting, Waldo...
What have I done? Looks like I've killed him...
Oh shit...  I'd better not hang around!

Berries
I don't think these berries are gonna help me open the mechanism.
Take the red berries.
Might come in handy.
Examine the berries
That's what you generally feed birds.

Chocolates. It's said they cause nightmares, but I doubt that's what my mother was trying to say.
No hidden mechanisms here. I'll have to look elsewhere.
Let's take a closer look... 
Take a chocolate
Dark chocolate beans. Very bitter.
They're greatly prized in high society.
Examine the chocolates
Judging by the shape, I'd say they're Criollo coco beans. The chocolate of the Mayas, the rarest of the beans.
Some even say they're an aphrodisiac... 
When a product is in fashion, people attribute all sorts of virtues to it... 
Not to be given to animals.
The dessert the most in vogue nowadays!
These chocolates are probably a protocol gift. Everybody in Europe loves them nowadays.
Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, has her own personal chocolate maker at Versailles.
