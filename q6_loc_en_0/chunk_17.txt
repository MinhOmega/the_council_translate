Monsieur President, what do you think about your counterpart, Duke Manuel?
I'm very surprised he was able to accept Lord Mortimer's invitation, given the political situation in Spain.
Speak about the rumors.
Sadly, people are more preoccupied with his ties to the Queen than they are with his talents as a statesman.
And it is indeed regrettable because he is nonetheless still an important leader.
I am not a man who pays attention to gossip, you know... 
What context?
What do you mean?
The situation is ready to explode with France over Catalonia.
Well, the Duke must have a darn good reason to be absent and come here, mustn't he?
When Lord Mortimer invites you, Louis, you come.
It's always in your best interest.
I wouldn't say that personally, but... 
He must have a good reason.
I wonder what promise Lord Mortimer could have made, to make him agree to come here, given the circumstances.
Who knows... 
Tell me more about the coming conference.
Monsieur President, can you tell me a little more about the coming conference?
Of course, Louis.
That's why we're here.
Lord Mortimer or Sir Gregory regularly organize meetings like this to put forward major projects.
What do you mean by "major projects"?
I'd prefer to let Lord Mortimer explain that to you, Louis.
Let's say he brings together influential people in order to consider possible actions to undertake to guarantee the future of nations.
Do you know the theme of the conference?
Not in the slightest. None of the guests know the theme before arriving.
But you'll see, everything will turn out fine. Don't worry.
Take your leave.
Well, thank you for your time.
Don't mention it, my young friend.
Regarding your question on the nightmare, don't hesitate to question the others about it.
Maybe one of them knows more than I do.
That's a good idea.
I saw the duchess move towards the upper floors and his Eminence head towards the dining room.
As for Monsieur Bonaparte, he remained in the small salon, if I'm not mistaken.
Thank you, once again.
I'll see you in a little bit.
Speak about the “nightmare”.
“Go beyond the nightmare”... 
Does this line remind you of anything in particular?
You've caught me unaware here, Louis.
Let me think about it a second..
No, nothing comes to mind.
Sorry, Louis, but I am unable to help you.
Ask him his opinion of Godoy.

Look, a pack of tarot cards.
Has he been reading the cards?
Mortimer? That would surprise me.
Read the draw.
It is a typical "draw in a line" that answers a specific question... 
To the left, Temperance, that announces a reward for one who patiently waits before taking any action... 
And in the middle, the Chariot which symbolizes triumph and business success... 
To the right, the Emperor evokes a future full of power and stability...
