I don't understand, I w...  I was cert... 
Right, leave it to me. I'll try and find the solution!
Well, well, well, poking our nose into Mortimer's little secrets, are we ?
You do surprise me.
It's not what you're thinking.
I'll explain everything..
No, you will not, Sir!
It has nothing to do with me, and by the way, I never even saw you.
So, I'll be on my way now.
Thanks again.
Why such indulgence?
You had me trapped...  Why not say anything?
I would have wanted someone to open the door for me, too.
And while it's too late for me, it may not be for you... 
I don't understand, I... 
I owe him one.
I'm indebted to you. I won't forget this!
Yeah...  Goodbye.
The wheels are stuck! Shit! I'm cornered like a rat!
Someone's coming... 
Please, don't let it be Mortimer!
Of course! How could I even imagine he would be here!
Who is it?
Deliberately avoiding me! Four years ago I was his favorite but nowadays I have to ask for an audience with his lordship... 
Dammit! It's Péru... 
Keep quiet
I don't know if I should but... 
Well, that's it! I've had enough of being humiliated!!
I'm wasting my time here... 
Call for help
Monsieur Péru!
It's Monsieur de Richet. I'm sort of trapped behind this painting.
Help me out of here, please!
What are you playing at, goddammit!
How can I open it?
After everything I've done on his behalf, he dares treat me like a lackey!
Keep quiet
I've bled the Parisian elite for the sake of his whims and what have I got to show for it?
Doesn't even have the courtesy to give me five minutes of his time!
I wanted to put my mind at ease...  Well that's done. I know what I've got to to do now.
I must find my mother!  So much for discretion..
Monsieur Péru?
It's me, Monsieur de Richet. I need your help... 
What the devil is going on... ?
Where are you, de Richet?
Behind the painting. Open it, please, I've shut myself in.
Call for help
Monsieur Péru!
It's Monsieur de Richet. I've locked myself in behind the painting.
Help me get out, please!
What are you playing at, goddammit!
There's a pedal under Lord Mortimer's desk.
Can you see it?
There's no...  hang on, yes... 
Good, now press it.
Yeah, yeah...  Done.
You should see something resembling a frame with numbers... 
Yes...  You have to turn them to set the combination.
1191
1191!
1911
1911 !
1991
1991 !
1119
1119 !
It's not working.
You sure about this?
I don't understand, I w...  I was cert... 
Right, leave it to me. I'll try and find the solution!

Examine the material
Looks like obsidian, or onyx. It must weigh a ton... 
Examine the inscriptions
Strange...  I don't recognize the alphabet. I wonder where the pictograms are from?
It isn't Egyptian or Hebrew.
There are two inscriptions on the sides as well as on the top.
No way to know what's underneath.
Absolutely no idea what it's for, but I find this cube fascinating.
