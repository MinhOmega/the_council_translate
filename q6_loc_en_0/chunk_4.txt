It must have been Emma I saw in my vision...
I was given to understand that my mother and your sister bonded during their stay.
Speak about the messages.
They kept up a secret correspondence, which makes me think they were suspicious of someone.
And did you find out who it was?
No, but Von Wöllner is mentioned.
They were planning to make a quick getaway and were looking to hide something beforehand.
Have you got these messages?
Show her
Yes, go ahead, take a look.
I see.
I must say...  thanks for your honesty, Louis.
Say no
Oh, no, sorry. Someone was coming so I had to burn them so as not to been seen with them.
You burned them...  Very well.
Ask her to “Go beyond the nightmare”
I've got a question that might seem a little bit strange...
I'm listening.
If I said “Go beyond the nightmare”, would that ring any bells?
Mmmm... No, means nothing to me...
Do you mean literally or figuratively speaking?
Literally, why not a place.
It might be a place. I don't know where but it's a lead.
You ought to ask his Eminence; he knows the house and its estate very well, being a frequent visitor here.
Thanks for the advice.
Figuratively, no doubt a metaphor
My mother used to talk about it. In the figurative sense, probably.
We still need to understand what she was referring to, though.
If I find something, I'll let you know.
Don't send her on my mother's trail.
If Mother's really killed her sister, I'd better find her by myself.
They say they spent a lot of time together.
They got along well.
Oh, really?
Do you think your mother liked Duchess Hillsborrow?
Of course, she did. After all, she's your sister.
Well, We'll find them, Emily. Trust me.
Let's go, Louis, they're waiting for us.
Should I speak to her about my vision? If what I saw is true, she might want to take revenge...
Tell her
Emily...  There's something else...
Go on then.
It's...  It's about your sister.
I don't know what happened exactly, but it's possible that my mother had a go at her.
I know, Louis. I found out that same evening.
Well, thanks for not trying to hide it.
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know if I could trust you.
Now I know I can.
It seems that your mother tricked Emma. She apparently asked her to hide an important book, so that even she wouldn't know where it was.
And then she shot her like a dog to make sure no one would ever find it again.
Does she know why?
Why would she do that?
I don't know Louis.
But I'll find out, you can count on that!
Who spoke to her about it?
How did you find out?
Sir Gregory told me on my arrival.
Keep quiet
I'd better keep that to myself for the time being...
I'm sincerely sorry, Emily.
Thank you, Louis.
You're very kind, it means a lot to me.
But you do realize your mother will have to accept the consequences of her acts.
But, there must be an explanation, Emily...
That's what we shall see.
We'll speak about it later somewhere...  safe.
Come Louis, they're waiting for us.
Emily, I must speak to you...
What's the matter, Louis?
About...  last night, I'm guessing?
I...  sadly, no, even if I'd have liked to, I...
Alas, there are more pressing matters...
I have news about your sister.
What have you found out?
Look. I've started piecing together the events leading up to my mother's disappearance...  and your sister's.
Did...  did my mother know about your secret?
Yes, even though I belong to the English chapter, her rank in the Order gives her access to a good deal of personal information.
