I hope you'll appreciate the irony of the situation.

Dear Lord Mortimer,
As agreed, I have changed your old lock for one of my invention.
Drawing inspiration from your doctor friend, Mister Guillotin, here is the model of your new lock, if you appreciate my prototype.
It is difficult to imagine how it all fits together, but it will be located in the middle of the present door.
The aim being to alter nothing of the door's functionality, but to add a bit of spice.
Depending on the line-up of the wheels, the aforementioned lock will open, or will punish the snooper whose faith is not strong enough.
I called my invention: The Judgment of faith, because if a snooper is unable to resist opening it, they will be punished...
I hope you'll appreciate the irony of the situation.

An iron mask... 
I wonder who it's for?

Preservation using formaldehyde... 
Just as disgusting as ever.

Oh shit! How am I gonna get out of here now?

It's a map of Africa.
It shows the forces present in Africa.
This is unexpected activity in this sector. It looks like there are also many unknowns, even for Mortimer.
Analyze the geopolitical situation.
Moreover, it shows a fair number of sea voyages being organized toward the American continent...  no doubt with slaves.
How many men are broken in this "trade"? Tens of thousands each year, according to what people say...

It's a map of Asia.
A fine-looking map of the Orient indeed.
The colors here look nothing like the ones I saw on the other maps.

It's a map of Europe.
It shows the forces present in Europe. It's clear that France is surrounded by her enemies.
However, a large number has been underlined in bold: 26 million.
I know what it is: it's an estimation of my country's population. All our neighbors have far fewer inhabitants.
Analyze the geopolitical situation.
It looks like a campaign is being prepared in France against Italy. Could Mortimer have decided to finance a war?

It's a map of the Americas... 
This shows the forces present in America.
Analyze the geopolitical situation. 
Some of those forces are pushing toward the west.
On it, Mortimer has placed little feather symbols at different points, toward which the Spanish are headed.
Could he be fueling Indian resistance to slow down Spain?

You will pay dearly, Péru!
I'm sure you were involved somewhere along the line!
That's right, pretend you don't know.
One piece of advice, don't travel through France on your way back or it will cost you dearly.
Come now, my friends. Let's calm down.
Everyone seems to be a little unnecessarily heated. Don't forget where you are, please.
What's going on here exactly?
Sir Gregory called us together to introduce the last guest... 
... but hardly had we arrived when he set upon Monsieur Péru.
Who is it?
And who is this charming character?
Manuel Godoy, the Duke of la Alcudia.
He's the head of the Spanish government, Monsieur de Richet.
He's the one who, in practice, controls Spain.
Dammit, it's him whom my mother spoke about in the letter on the wharf.
Why?
And what has Monsieur Péru done to once again provoke someone's anger?
We don't really know just yet.
I get the feeling it won't be long before it gets out... 
How could you dare do such a thing? You're all out of your minds!
Really, Duke Manuel, what's made you kick up such a fuss?
What, have you not heard?
Well, let me inform you that yesterday morning, at 10:22 am precisely, in the middle of the Place de la Révolution in Paris,
by decree of the National Convention which Monsieur Péru works for, King Louis was guillotined.
What?!!
The King of France is dead, gentlemen!
Our monarchies are in danger! I have said it before!
How dare they?
Friends, friends...  let us calm down...
