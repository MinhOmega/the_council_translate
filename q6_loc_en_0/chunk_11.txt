Don't pretend to be surprised. He got a fair trial!
Ridiculous! Bastard!
He was sentenced to death by 361 votes to 360.
You beheaded a King for ONE vote...  Is that your democracy?
What an obnoxious act.
Until this, anything was possible. This political coup will have grave consequences!
France is lost... 
Gentlemen, please, let us take a step back a moment.
In the name of holiness, he was the highest representative of God in France, Emily!
Put oil on the flame
Well, King Louis was imprisoned for several months, as far as I know.
What have your governments been doing to change France's resolution?
I beg your pardon?
I've heard you cackling like outraged old hens for a while now, but you had every opportunity to take a stance beforehand, if I'm not mistaken.
That is a characteristic of Noblemen, Louis. You'll soon get used to it here.
Gentlemen, that is enough.
Calm things down.
Gentlemen, Duchess, we are among people of reputable company here.
We should be able to manage the conflicts of our nations in a respectful and orderly manner.
I fully agree with you, sir.
But... 
That's enough, sir.
Think of the consequences for the Order.
If I remember rightly what Mother told me one night, King Louis was secretly also part of the Order.
I wonder what impact his death will have on us.
Sad news, sir.
Say nothing
... 
With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Louis Mauras de Richet.
Are you related to Sarah de Richet?
Sarah is his mother, Duke.
Gentlemen, this news affects us all but I must ask you to remain calm.
It's not the first time History has taken us by surprise.
Let's ensure that our respective countries are allowed to respond appropriately to this news.
Oh, rest assured, the response will not fall short, my friend.
Good for you.
Well, your Grace, here I was preparing to introduce you as is proper, and you've beaten me to it.
I'm delighted that we are all together at last. Our meeting will therefore be able to kick off shortly.
I have just a few more little preparations to take care of before you all find out the reason for your presence here.
In the meantime, I shall leave you to get to know one another.
When you hear the bell, please proceed to the conclave room on my left, behind that door.
I'll see you later.
You will pay dearly, Péru!
I'm sure you were involved somewhere along the line!
That's right, pretend you don't know.
One piece of advice, don't travel through France on your way back or it will cost you dearly.
Come now, my friends. Let's calm down.
Everyone seems to be a little unnecessarily heated. Don't forget where you are, please.
What's going on here exactly?
Sir Gregory called us together to introduce the last guest... 
... but hardly had we arrived when he set upon Monsieur Péru.
Who is it?
And who is this charming character?
Manuel Godoy, the Duke of la Alcudia.
He's the head of the Spanish government, Monsieur de Richet.
He's the one who, in practice, controls Spain.
Dammit, it's him whom my mother spoke about in the letter on the wharf.
Why?
And what has Monsieur Péru done to once again provoke someone's anger?
We don't really know just yet.
I get the feeling it won't be long before it gets out... 
How could you dare do such a thing? You're all out of your minds!
Really, Duke Manuel, what's made you kick up such a fuss?
What, have you not heard?
Well, let me inform you that yesterday morning, at 10:22 am precisely, in the middle of the Place de la Révolution in Paris,
by decree of the National Convention which Monsieur Péru works for, King Louis was guillotined.
What?!!
The King of France is dead, gentlemen!
Our monarchies are in danger! I have said it before!
How dare they?
Friends, friends...  let us calm down... 
Don't pretend to be surprised. He got a fair trial!
Ridiculous! Bastard!
He was sentenced to death by 361 votes to 360.
