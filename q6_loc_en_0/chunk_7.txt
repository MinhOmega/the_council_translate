There are two inscriptions on the sides as well as on the top.
No way to know what's underneath.
Absolutely no idea what it's for, but I find this cube fascinating.
Move away
Something strange about this table...
Examine the equipment
What kind of experiments does Mortimer carry out here?
It's a dissection table...  So Mortimer does autopsies...  here on his desert island?
But who is he doing autopsies on then?
Look at the instruments
The little surgeon's perfect collection...

This is my mother's writing! I've picked up her trail!
What is she up to?
Obviously she wants to lure Mortimer somewhere but...  but where?
The only clue she's left for Mortimer is this stone sword. It must be intentional.
Looks like a decorative sword like...  from a statue, for example.
And judging by the state of it, I'm...  I'm guessing it's been left outside for a long time.
I have absolutely got to find out where it came from!

Before I look at anything else, I must inspect the painting of the Nightmare.

I still haven't found anything about my mother... 
I've got to keep searching. I must have missed something!

Well? What's all this about?

So, what did my mother mean by “going beyond the nightmare”?

The book of the Mortimer family.
Hmm, nope...  no mechanism here.
Presentation of the Mortimer family.
Well, well...  history of the Mortimer lineage.
Looks like his ancestors have always sought to improve society, and have had an open attitude towards the arts...
Family tree
Oh, the family tree!
William Alexander Mortimer, first of his name.
The first William Alexander Mortimer.
He was born in 1131 and distinguished himself during the Third Crusade during which he rubbed shoulders with Richard the Lionheart.
He showed outstanding bravery during the siege of Saint Jean d'Acre.
He died in 1211, in the county of Westford at the age of 80. What longevity! Nice!
Nothing is mentioned about his wife.
William Terrence Mortimer
The direct descendant of William Alexander Mortimer I was born in 1195, on his father's return from the Crusade.
Only son. More discreet than his father, it states that he was widely traveled.
He produced only one descendant, named William Michael Mortimer.
He died in 1275. There's no chapter dedicated to his mother.
Look for the last descendant.
Lord William Alexander Mortimer.
Lover of the Arts and the Sciences, he took up politics at an early age.
After rapidly becoming influential, he decides to retire from public life...
... in order to organize conferences reserved for the elite with the aim of finding answers to world problems.
Blah, blah, blah...
He's also an only son and the book doesn't mention any known descendant.
See other ancestors
Alright...  for one, the women of the lineage are not mentioned at all. What a cavalier attitude!
Right, let's see...  Who else is there?
William Berth Mortimer
Only son. A descendant with a singular name. He also took a wife, and had only one child. Named William, again.
William August Mortimer
Another at random. William Mortimer, again! Only son, him too. Born in 1573 and died in 1665: the Mortimers live to a ripe old age, that's for sure!
Discreet, again. The summary states that he was an excellent merchant...  and that, towards the end of his life, he entered politics.
Analyze the familial organization
All the descendants are called William (... ) Mortimer. There have been only male descendants. All of them only sons.
Strange...  it was uncommon to have only one child in those days, let alone all only sons!
How is that possible? It really makes you wonder if all those sons really are official descendants...
I'm smelling something shady here...

Analyze the names
Let's see. All Mortimer's ancestors are called “William (something) Mortimer”.
